Unless you are a ultra conservative republican who would have great troubles understanding this film, this was very well written movie about a deeply flawed Hero adn heroine in a deeply flawed time. If,however, you are a moderate you will truly enjoy this film. It highlights the dangers of 'over-government', media manipulation, the problem of defining a terorist and many other issues very real and pertintant to today's world. I have read many review about this film harping on it 'glorifying terrorism' and for those who think it does, they have missed the points of the film altogether. The hero is a deeply flawed almost anti-hero who takes revenge on those who have destroyed his life and killed many that he has considered comrades by their circumstance being the same as his own. His revenge is mixed with his ideas of changing the world and become convoluted beggintg the question to be asked on what is justice and what is revenge and whether murder is justified. I have seen other reviewers saying it is attacking America, and yet the story is based in England about an English government. Yes, America is mentioned but it is not the focus. Very clearly, and on many occasions the storyline follows the basic premise: the people get the government they deserve either by action or inaction. The hero belives he will be able to stir the country to make choices again by removing the fear that has paralyzed them. A fantastic film that deserves discussion."" ]";0.18615384615384611;

Luckily, for the rest of us, this film will do just fine, because the enlightened viewer will realize that The Hurt Locker isn't about the details, but the big picture. It's a document of what a war like this means and how it affects the participants on both sides. It's neither pro-war nor anti-war, but instead just shows the ways things are without pronouncing judgment on its characters or their actions. It's also a showcase for some of the most impressive action and suspense set pieces to grace the cinema in a very long time.

Out of all the trailers and interviews that were done on the movie there was one in particular, an interview done with director J.J. Abrams, that stuck out to me. Having written the script himself with the help of Lawrence Kasdan, the mastermind behind arguably the best Star Wars film \""The Empire Strikes Back\"", Abrams said that the movie was going back to its original roots and the whole film was basically a faithful recreation of the space magic George Lucas had once shown us. After watching the film, I couldn’t agree more or less with his statement. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is an embodiment of the original trilogy (the good ones of course) that we all got to love and worship and, furthermore, is a testament to the fact that regardless of the crazy hype and commercialization the old sci-fi space adventure franchise still stands firm through the ages, enough for audiences of all shapes and sizes to thoroughly enjoy and be happy with.

Surprisingly enough, he exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialogue was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but it was witty, enjoyable, and had a solid point. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult.

non-stop-2014;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Non-Stop is a 2014 mystery suspense action thriller set aboard a flight from New York to London, starring none other than Liam Neeson. It’s fortunately not in the style of Taken, whereby almost everything is offset by enjoyable, brainless action and a completely illogical plot, but this being from this specific genre with Liam Neeson it’s often hard to let off so easily. Sure, we gain a sympathetic situation from an air marshal with horrific problems to deal with (I couldn’t help it when it was announced his daughter had died from acute leukaemia at the age of 8, mirrored with the conversation with Jennifer about the blue ribbon that his 17 year old daughter had given him because despite being who he is, he’s still pretty much a damaged person), the film itself doesn’t often follow through with the morality themes it has given itself. To an extent, it is entertaining in a better way that you have to use your brain (for the most part), but has an ancient habit of not in the least well done plot devices."", """", ""Liam Neeson is Bill Marks, an air marshal, who discovers the flight he is on has someone threatening to kill a passenger on board every 20 minutes if $150 million is not wired to a given account number. The set-up is simple and solid and we come to an understanding of a thrilling suspense ride that combines both intelligence and action. The hype is definitely not surprising."", """", ""We gain much of this from the acknowledgement of the question many people would be asking: “How do you kill someone on a passenger plane without anyone noticing?” I mean, with the limited space 40,000 ft. above the ground, it would be too easy. That film wouldn’t exactly be the most popular."", """", ""It helps that we are given a conventional beginning to lead us through, with the usual action of boarding the plane (his alcoholism is prominent right from the start) and interacting with crew members and passengers. In particular he takes a shine to Jennifer Summers (played by Julianne Moore) and manages to find trust in Steward Nancy Hoffman (played by Michelle Dockery)."", """", ""This is significant to the plot strength, because if he is to discover how someone kills someone aboard a passenger plane discreetly, he needs to know about the other passengers and that includes asking for help. Although, there’s a weakness here – of course it’s meant to be difficult considering the circumstances and what better way than to throw a plot twist in there? However, it does stretch out coherently enough, really only until the final act where a plot device manages to make its way in."", """", ""What doesn’t make sense is that Bill gains and regains people’s trust too quickly in spite of the revelations. Perhaps the sympathy card was played for that reason – they can’t trust him enough as an air marshal but after airing his problems people have no other idea but to. I suppose it wouldn’t work if he didn’t have the jaded persona, but at the same time it doesn’t come naturally. If they had only one reason to trust him it would be because what he was doing was trying to save their lives and that they had to. The media is a volatile outlet and to retract the statement of being the FBI’s (we’re talking high class investigation here) prime suspect in a hijacking wouldn’t be that easy to do."", """", ""The film sometimes forgets that it aims to bring its own morality to the table due to its own idea of logic."", ""The distrust is too often forgotten, the theme of futility and hope getting more intermittent as the film progresses and whether the physics of being able to muffle a bomb blast in an airplane while managing to land it and have the present passengers all survive still sounds questionable. But a specific saving grace happens to be a young girl named Becca, travelling alone to meet her father, a walking symbol of a fragment of Bill’s life that he can finally share an experience with that he was never able to last with his own daughter. The blue ribbon being quite obvious."", """", ""To an extent, this film is an enjoyable ride that sets up on a take-off with a solid, excusable premise that misses points and jumps too quickly. It is refreshing to see a wide range of people represented, showing a distinctive power of a lack of discrimination. When Bill doesn’t know who to trust, it’s simple to know he’s doing it out of a genuine lack of knowledge and that he addresses those he needs to in order to know what’s really going on. What doesn’t work though, is that what ends up as a possible development ends up being squandered for the usual kind of ending – Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson looking at each other in the style of a happy ending of a romantic comedy. Being a mystery suspense action thriller, that’s definitely not what I was expecting (for a Liam Neeson film, I was hoping he didn’t have to do this)."" ]";0.13276502567200238;

We get it, Peter gets bitten by a spider and gains superpowers, but what it was mainly setting up was for us to find out about a guy trying to achieve perfection who ends up turning into a giant lizard and terrorising the city. As well as revisiting familiar plot points, it gave us something fairly useless to go on - we could have known more about Peter's parents. Besides that, the characters themselves provided better entertainment, which is for the fact that good humour is something I like in films, but, ironically, Peter Parker had little depth despite being the main character.

But what I must point out is the length of film is always important to note - I felt it was too short to hold my attention. I wanted to know more. As it was quite short, it is also useful to illustrate the pacing, as it realised it had to skip certain areas, rushing in order to make the 85-90 minute time limit. The beginning normally needs to either fill us in properly on background detail or give us time to develop it during the disaster. Although this did happen throughout the film, we did get a little background detail of some of the main characters. What made this film not sink into bad territory was the continued update of the journey to escape from the electric creatures, which I thought were awesome. It was quite courageous to use them as the mainspring in this film, as it was obvious in this situation that it was a devastating attack.

It sounded extremely fascinating when I first heard about this, mostly considering there were some great actors in it, like David Tennant and Colin Farrell. When I did see this a couple of days ago, I suddenly agreed with my previous statement. To make it more effective, my parents turned out all the lights in the house, so all I could see was this disturbing glow of a bloodthirsty vampire tearing out someone's throat. Colin Farrell makes for a very effective vampire; (he was my favourite character) he didn't really scare me, he was more creepy than that. He certainly had the look and quality of a vampire. Remakes aren't normally as good as the original, but despite the normality, the acting, the dialogue, the atmosphere - it all creeped the hell out of me. This is also fantastically gory and the actors just passed swiftly under it, refusing to give in despite the fact that there was a vampire on the loose. Nothing like Twilight - as Ed described Jerry (cool name for a supernatural creature by the way) - he's the freaking shark from Jaws. In fact, this is very, very good quality. Would have liked it to have a higher score, but at least the reviews were mostly favourable. It just seemed a damn shame that I didn't see it when it came out, especially in 3D.

It is dealt with spectacularly, but it was obvious that this proves a real take on something that goes so much unnoticed, dealing with science-fiction that possesses a more emotional and metaphorical nature. The computer, played with a surprisingly lack of monotone by the rightfully chosen Kevin Spacey, is given a personality with a much different result compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey."", ""Sam Rockwell's performance couldn't have been done with a different appearance, his voice able to express wild emotion and a casual tone of both indifference and contentment.

The college student was a fair target, considering who they were aiming for. However, this becomes a side issue among the division between the predictability and the actual exploration of humanity's frightening procrastination at becoming old and unable to go through life. This was in contrast with turning it into some kind of fashion statement, as if artificiality and beauty can prolong meaning of life itself. Bruce Willis is ultimately superb in this role, considerably cynical and not sarcastic, distinctive in a world of people who are plugged into androids.

What might have been missed is the intellect that was deduced by Holmes, and that people may more have noticed the significant amount of violence because of it being seen on screen, and you have to look closer in order to pick up the lesser significant and more unnoticed details. Sherlock Holmes may have had violence and explosions in it, but it showed Holmes as an experienced person that didn't just go around injuring people for the fun of it. He looked for clues, he came to conclusions, he used logic. Ritchie may have spiced up this new Holmes a little more than people expected, but it added to the fun of the movie. It didn't show him in a new light, it just showed us his capabilities and his strength for his environment. People might not have picked up on this, and the fact it might have been 'too complicated and boring' means that they probably weren't focusing on it as such to figure it out for themselves. You might have expected what was going to happen, seeing as it was based on a piece of famous literature, but Sherlock Holmes of course is opened to interpretation. Then why go in there and see it, not bother to focus on the finer details, at least enjoy the film, and beforehand think you're going to expect something completely different? It's confusing how people thought this film would happen, and how it was going to turn out. With all these production teams and crews designing and creating this imaginative piece of media, why think you're going to get a tame bunch of people solving mysteries without any spice like the book says?"", ""I, myself, loved the performance by Robert Downey Jr., who seemed to fit into the role like a glove. Why bother with any other actor when you've got him around to play a bohemian detective who performs experiments on animals (O.K, a little out of touch there)? Although he's American, that was not a barrier to him when he spoke in a brilliant Victorian English accent.  It's harder than you think trying to cast these people, and what better way than such a famous star? Not to mention the good-looking British actor Jude Law, who, fair to say, did a superb job as Dr. Watson. Not bad picking an actor who lives on the opposite side of the pond, as they say."", ""As I said, I think many people missed out on the joyfulness and intellect of the film, because there was so much in there to look for. The characters themselves were not on a 'clown caper' or some unimportant journey as such, but I think there was more to them than people actually thought. Although films are for entertainment, you can also see the difference between this and what Conan Doyle wrote. It's a free country when it comes to this kind of interpretation, as Ritchie did nothing to harm one of the most famous fictional characters in history. The darkness of it did not put me off at all, it merely added to the climax, and it was extremely useful in aiding the referencing of the character's next worst scheming supervillain, Professor Moriarty. Since when can films like these pull of darkness, action, mystery and suspense, comedy and adventure without screwing up? And here we have it, a solid gold take on the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes.

equilibrium;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""An underrated piece of art, this bleak future where emotions are forbidden has an ironic emotional core to it. It doesn't surround itself with blatant copies of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, in fact, what many people would assume are carbon copies I would prefer to call references, harking back to other dystopian films while also being a standalone film in its own right. Equilibrium treats the matter with mild stoicism, foreshadowing particular events in a neat way that manages to explode in a thrilling yet thoughtful way. The ignorance of many critics that assumed the worst, didn't seem to see the whole picture. None of this was about the fact that censorship exists or that you could be executed for certain crimes. The whole idea of the film was to make you see how people behaved through lack of emotion, with the failure to see that emotion is what makes us human. Rather than take a purely political motive, it manages to incorporate perhaps a majorly ethical motive. The action that is contained in this film is not just for showing off. The stylistic features render the action scenes mindblowing, but no less helping to drive the core theme of the story - besides, the main character is a cleric, trained in the art of Gun Kata (a thrilling name for a sadly non-existent masterpiece of fighting style) who manages to put a chink in Libria's armour as we see through his perspective by realising he can use this weapon against the system that attempts and fails to betray him as someone who is 'feeling'. When I first regarded this film, I became fascinated about how, amongst the close-ups and wider shots, the main character seems to obviously show some kind of emotion without the intrusion of the system demanding why on earth he hasn't been arrested for his crimes. This ultimately came to the climax, whereby the foreshadowing managed to sneak its way in at the beginning. The fact that Christian Bale was chosen for this role makes me wonder why some people didn't think this was good, considering how deft he was in executing the action, the visual non-speaking scenes and the dialogue. To the amazing use of irony, a number of heart-rending scenes kept up the core theme, and the stylistic use of camera focus on Christian Bale emphasised the distress that we could feel he was going through, one being his flinching when we don't see the dogs being shot, but we can feel it by way of his reaction. However, I thought one of the most chilling scenes was during a raid of someone's apartment, with fires burning and people spattered with blood, was the simplicity of a dying man running into the main character, known as John Preston, bleeding, desperation and hope glittering in his eyes as he slides down, leaving Preston aghast and completely horrified, reflecting the man's pain. The expression on his face could not have been possibly matched, Christian Bale just executed that so perfectly that I could feel myself choking up and stopping dead. So this film, by none the way anything completely copied from other films, is a masterpiece in its own right. By way of insulting the stylistic features to convey emotion and provide thrilling action that shaped the film, the amazingly well-acted characters that were to no end incredibly fascinating, the amazingly clever storyline, you are refusing to take it to the light of some of the world's greatest films and distastefully making the biggest mistake of throwing it away. Like the scene in the film, whereby Preston awakes from a nightmare with shock and overwhelming emotion, tears away the fabric from the window to reveal glimmering light on the horizon and a rainbow glowing in the rain, it strips away the layers as the film goes on, lulling you into a false sense of security, but instead just brings you surprises exploding onto the scene, leaving you brimming with hope at the end.

spider-man;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I found Maguire portrayed Spider-Man in an accurate way - I don't think Parker is supposed to be cool and Maguire had that specific look about him. The story itself was entertaining, although it was slightly imbalanced in the way that we saw too much of Spider-Man rather than the villain, but that's not a particular problem, in way of the style of development of the story. Many of my concerns were with Mary Jane, who I felt kind of interfered in some scenes where she tried too hard to look independent but it was obviously see through as she behaved much more desperate and helpless. The villain was O.K, but I think his costume looked a bit childish and plasticky. This film is entertaining but it is flawed. Maguire is an extremely good Spider-Man - much better suited to the role than Garfield - but it was mostly the other characters who needed more space and time to improve in light of the flaws that I have pointed out."" ]";0.1818840579710145;

It's not like they treat you as human beings, pickled on drugs and manipulated through humiliation."", ""But, the role of this anti-authoritarian rebel, who goes along the name of Randle P. McMurphy and the main protagonist of this inspirational film, is perfectly suited to a gentleman called, and of which became his debut award-winning role, Jack Nicholson. A choice of a lifetime - either that, it would take him years to get noticed, probably. Do you think he would have gained roles in such films as As Good As It Gets, playing an obsessive compulsive with an attitude problem? Something's Gotta Give? Anger Management? He certainly looked like he deserved that Academy Award for best actor, which is quite a stupid statement, because he did."", ""And who wouldn't give to play a role, a role against an autocratic system. Somehow a sad, somehow ferocious battle. The main antagonist, Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, as well as having a name that sounds like a sharp, steel knife, a cold, biting winter, making you think of scratchy, horrible things, it was her calm, yet within, sadistic, demeanour that somehow took a strong grip, on not just the ward full of patients with multi-layered problems, but the audience. The involvement creates a chilling and uncomfortable atmosphere, yet you carry on watching the film because you want to see what happens within this system, being just so engrossed in it to not stop watching it. It's films like these that keep us on our toes and feel for ourselves the control and power that these patients experienced."", ""I cannot predict people's reactions for the ending, although it might be obvious to some. There is always a difference between the book and the film. Chief Bromden, apart from Randle, (or 'Mack', how he is called), is sane, not exactly showing it in the beginning. Seems like a one way ticket to peace and tranquillity, but it is fortunate enough that Randle was lucky to be there with him in the first place. Instead of thinking that the villains have to have their way, it is often an accomplishment within the human spirit, and Randle certainly brought the spirit within the hospital. Winning 5 Academy Awards which including Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) and Best Screenplay, this psychological drama is none more deserving which makes you think more about the society we live in. And for me? A touching poignant idea on the idea of an autocratic society, and the strength of the human spirit."" ]";0.14918453639383872;

To show you that you shouldn't blow all your life away, because of life's unpredictability. This had a meaning, a PROPER meaning, unlike other movies. I would highly recommend this movie, because when you cry during this movie, you will feel better for it. Sometimes it's good to cry, and where a movie can make you laugh and cry around the same time, there's no way you'd want to miss this.

This is not supposed to be a weepy film, it is a film of beauty and wonder, of the dark and light sides of the human condition. It just dips enough to get us to think what might be right for people with disabilities and leaves us to make our own assumptions on this sort of issue. Of course, both main characters aren't numb, sometimes they just hide their feelings away, but we can obviously see how both of their lives entwine, without turning into a tear-jerking drama.

This was better than good, and so I felt like a fish being lured towards bait on a hook. Not many action-films can pull of that kind of humour without being childish or crude. So far that I've seen any other superhero, like Batman, or Superman, or Spiderman, Iron Man provides an equal balance of human qualities and superhuman strengths. It would be difficult to find any other man apart from Robert to portray the **** almost conceited playboy multi-talented millionaire, to which there would be an impossible answer to find.

The actors are perfect for their roles - their contrast provided the strength it needed to maintain the thickening plot. Very good comedy - I think it weighed it down a little, which is often a side effect of trying to implement comedy so forcefully just because it was a comedy. But the upside was that it was funny anyway without trying too hard. What I didn't get about this film was that it was sometimes confusing and kept changing direction - which is difficult when you're trying to maintain a couple of sub-plots, and I don't think this handled it very well. The comedy made it more than bearable though and the film didn't just become overly benign, self-centred on making the audience feel really sorry for the characters.

The film was a little light for my liking, preferring to not explain the circumstances surrounding what was actually going on between the two main characters. I like both of the actors, but their cute looks gave me more a sense of confusion between seriousness and cheerfulness. Was it supposed to be this confusing, or does this genuinely try and portray complications within a relationship, if you could call what they were going through a relationship?

It was crazy at times, there wasn't much talking and sometimes I felt it wasn't really trying too hard to not be what it was supposed to - an art-house film.

signs;9;YoursTruly;"[ ""I watch this every chance I get. As far as alien invasion fiction goes, this is not the most intricate or the most compelling. In fact, somehow, the alien's are a rather second-hand element in the film. It's more so about the family dynamics in a widowers household. The extra-terrestrial warfare is just the impetus that nudges them into situations where their personal stories can unfold and their deepest emotions can surface among one another. Directed with tact and steadfastness, acted with precision and beautifully paced to create an extremely hypnotizing atmosphere. Not to mention, infectiously hilarious on several occasions. This is a showcase in how to infuse subtle humor into a story. The jokes are super easy to miss and may very well go right over the heads of some which is unfortunate. But, by the same token, the quietness of all the funny along with the dimly lit environment in which it is placed really allows for it to illuminate like a firefly in the night sky and be a million times funnier than it would be in an in-your-face, no holds bar type of comedy.

It wasn't like watching a movie. It was more like watching a documentary. Because everything from the smallest facial expressions, to the most insignificant gestures is just saturated with texture and emotion. It's the quick and thoughtless remarks that the characters make, and the angles of certain glimpses of camera work that allow us, the audience, to understand what is really going on underneath all of the outward doings and occurrences. I was invested, I was interested, I was engaged and I cared about everything that was happening in this fictional world that died in two hours. Aspiring filmmakers, take notes.

Things move at a brisk pace as the movie tries to cram differing material from seven books into roughly an hour and a half, leading to a muddled story that rushes from plot point to plot point when it should be pacing itself and leaving the door open for potential sequels the way the books did. I will say this though, it's faithfulness to the lore of the series did make for a potentially satisfying continuation of The Dark Tower series. It's just that the emphasis on closing Roland's battle with Walter as quickly as possible means that it misses out on the true spirit of the books."", ""The relationship between Roland and Jake is never fleshed out as they barely have a moment to ever sit down and bond. Roland's backstory and the history of Mid-World are also barely touched on. Essentially what I'm trying to say is that the movie delivers a tale that deals with the deeper elements of The Dark Tower series, but simultaneously fails to use them or even talk about them. Something any fan of the books will tell you just isn't possible. The complexities of the story are essential to Roland's quest. Those who have read the series will be able to grasp what's going on, but a lot of newcomers are likely to find themselves lost in regards to anything but the surface conflict of Roland's hunt for Walter."", ""Stylistically the movie is an awkward combination of fantasy and science-fiction. The books were a combination of these two genres, as well as many others, so it's true to form in that regard. It's just not handled all that well here, leaving their union to feel jumbled and perhaps incoherent. At least to anyone who hasn't read through the King books. Everything is beautifully brought to life though. The action scenes themselves are quite impressive and a lot of fun to watch as they show off why Roland is such a force to be reckoned with. Despite it's weaker narrative this adaptation/sequel to The Dark Tower series has plenty of awesome material for longtime Dark Tower fans as well as those who have also enjoyed the larger catalog of King material. It's got a little something from each of the novels in the series, as well as quite a few nods to the larger Stephen King multiverse. The way the movie borrows bits and pieces from all sorts of different areas is sure to prove entertaining to the clued in. The casting is also phenomenal. Idris Elba captures the stoic, cold natured, yet deeply layered and surprisingly human nature of Roland with ease. I just wish he hadn't been given such goofy dialog. Matthew McConaughey is simultaneously menacing and playful. A great Walter/Martin/Randall Flagg/ect. Tom Taylor is the perfect Jake as well as the heart and soul of the film. The scenes and elements that have been adapted here are done quite well."", ""All in all The Dark Tower is an excellently cast film that brings a bunch of material from the books to the big-screen, but fails to bring them all together into a coherent whole. Yet, when all is said and done that which is here is likely to prove a blast for Stephen King's fanbase even if it isn't the truly satisfying adaptation/continuation of his magnum opus that we were all hoping for. It tries to satisfy longtime fans and create some new ones in the process. Ultimately it fails to do either thanks to impenetrable nature of the complex lore and it's flawed attempt at transferring the book's lengthy plot into the film format.

But Roderick? The parents? Why recast them? My best guess is that it was simply cheaper to hire them. Still, it's not like it helped the budget much. From what I've read it cost just as much to make this one as it did to make \""Dog Days.\"" The recasting wouldn't be so much of a problem if the new cast lived up to the old one. Unfortunately, they don't. They aren't as charming or likable, and they certainly don't have the same acting ability.

Wright in particular."", ""But let's be honest everybody, the issue with this movie isn't that there are a bunch of new faces playing old characters. It's that the material isn't as good. This is very much a Wimpy Kid movie. It's got the same visual style and it's all about watching Greg scheme and make things worse. It's just nowhere near as funny as what came before it. The majority of the one-liners and play on words fall flat on their face. There are humorous bigger gags that are pretty funny near the end of the movie. That's when \""The Long Haul\"" starts focusing less on the plot and instead on just screwing with the Heffleys as much as possible. So it's not like there aren't some laughs to be found.

Parents on the other hand are likely going to find themselves annoyed by the cheapness of the humor and unnecessary gross out gags."", ""As for the plot itself it's almost your typical Wimpy Kid setup. Greg concocts some scheme that naturally gets in the way of his parents plans which leads to a lot of crazy hijinks. Only this time around things are infused with a lot of cringe-inducing references to YouTube and the \""let's play\""-ers out there. That's right, the movie is trying way too hard to fit in with the kids. To be hip and cool. The writers know what's going on with the kids today. Always gotta be connected and stuff. Previous Wimpy Kid movies have kind of tied this to some kind of morals where Greg ultimately ends up learning something here. That doesn't really happen here. The movie sort of forgets to include the part where he learns his lesson in favor of all out chaos in the final act. I'm not complaining too much though because that's when the movie starts being funny."", ""In closing, it feels like no one was really trying with this one. A lazy cash-in on the name that's sure to disappoint quite a few fans. The casting is weaker, the writing is lackluster, and too often is it devoid of laughs. It's not a complete dud as the youngest of viewers will likely find themselves amused with it.

A shame as the first Pirates managed to both make us laugh and get invested in it's characters and plot. The whole cast is largely on point. Particularly the returning faces such as the always excellent Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally. Newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are basically just there to inject some new pretty faces into the mix, but they manage to fit in with the rest of the cast quite well. Fans will get a kick out of seeing the long-awaited return of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, even if only briefly. When all is said and done this latest Pirates flick gets more right than it does wrong. Especially when in comparison to those truly dreadful sequels that came before it. It makes Pirates fun again. The problem is that it's just lacking in any sort of depth. It's all about the jokes and flashy action, both of which it has in spades. Neither of those make for a great movie when the writing is weak and the villain is so sadly squandered, but at least it's entertaining.

However a much needed change in tone from the last movie and the infamous director not taking things seriously in any way make for a more enjoyable movie than one might expect.

Among them is Anthony Hopkins for some reason. Michael Bay clearly enjoyed having the respect actor around to use, and Hopkins himself seemed to be having a blast despite that starring in a movie like this is him just slumming it at this point in his career. While he still ain't no Labeouf, Mark Wahlberg's character is so much more likable this time around. Something that's due to the plot not giving him any extra baggage hanging around in the form of his character's obnoxious daughter and her useless, statutory rapist boyfriend (no, it's cool. There's this one law...). They, along with the material, aren't here to choke out the actor's natural charm. The material is so much lighter than that of the previous film \""Age of Extinction.\"" Bay goes for a lot of different kinds of gags and ends up filling the movie with almost wall-to-wall humor. A move that is much appreciated. The plot itself is crazy. It regularly jumps back and forth from different locations and even time periods in an effort to come off as complex. Instead it just feels convoluted. It's easy to lose track of certain characters as they get left behind for large parts of the film only to pop up later. I actually forgot about Cade Yeagers new human cohorts there for a while. Naturally, this isn't the kind of movie you watch for good writing. Michael Bay is known for making movies for teenage boys. Here he really embraces that."", ""The Last Knight is much lighter and surprisingly more diverse than the other Transformers films. You even get some pretty cool action scenes that aren't just explosion fests that rely more on the physicality of the actors. Of course there's also some gorgeous sci-fi scenery. Those underwater scenes are astounding. Ultimately, this is still pretty brainless entertainment. As far as the writing goes, it's the most incoherent Transformers yet.

We've all seen it before. although we haven't seen it delivered this awkwardly before. The movie's habit of cutting back and forth in time during several scenes is visually impressive, but jarring and at times a bit confusing from a story standpoint. It's also worth noting that this is the most dude-bro version of King Arthur we've had since Starz Camelot series. Charlie Hunman does make this incarnation more likable than Jamie Campbell Bower though. He's got genuine grit to back up that smart mouth and streetwise, rugged charm."", ""A touch ham-fisted with it's plot and world-building, Guy Ritchie's take on Arthurian legend does manage to be more fun and exciting than it has any right to be. It's understandable why the professional critics hated it. It is kind of one of those overblown, spectacle driven, and kind of dumb fantasy movies that are usually duds all the way around. However in Ritchie's capable hands \""Legend of the Sword\"" manages to avoid the usual pitfalls and elevates itself to simply good, flashy fun.

It's got the bombastic energy of an action film, the brutality of a serious war movie, and the heart and soul of a compelling human drama. This conclusion to the Reeves trilogy is excellent and hands down the best of the reboots.

Most of it comes from Lil Rel Howery, the main character's best friend. He serves as the comic relief and is given some absolutely hilarious lines that are well acted. Simply put, Get Out is one heck of a horror-comedy and a stunning directorial debut from Jordan Peele. I can't get over how talented the cast is, the unique and well-shot scenes, the clever ways it plays with expectations, and just all around uniqueness.

Unfortunately for the audience none of what he's showing them is scary."", ""Over the course of the movie we see that The Bye Bye Man's main approach to attacking these characters is to make our lead (Douglas Smith) imagine that his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend. He does this by playing on the character's already established insecurities. His best friend does get weirdly handsy with his girlfriend and openly flirts with her after all. None of which she discourages and even seems to kind of enjoy. All of this happens right in front of his face. Lucky for him he's \""not the jealous type.\"" So it's kind of nifty to see the villain play on that. But you know what it isn't? Scary. It's just not scary. Now eventually these visions start to get a little bloodier, but there's never any sense of tension or fear. Along the way Carrie-Ann Moss for some reason and has her talent totally wasted by being shoved into a do nothing role."", ""To top things off it's just not very well made either. With the exception of Moss, the cast is terrible. None of them can act. The worst offender by far is Cressida Bonas. Not only does she no emotion or believability, but her voice is awful. Every time she spoke I just wanted to stab myself in the ears. As soon as she opens her mouth it's like nails on a chalkboard. The characters themselves suck too. Everyone is there to make stupid decisions or bore us by being too slow to grasp what is obviously going on. Well, everyone except Lucien Laviscount. He's there to be an irrational jerk and hit on his best-friend's girl. How were we supposed to care about anyone here?"", ""When watching this you'll naturally find yourself asking why The Bye Bye Man is doing all of this. He's a very enigmatic character, but not in a good way. The movie tells us nothing about him. A shame because he's the interesting part of the movie! It's one of the things holding this movie back. There's the potential here for a cool new horror movie villain. However, it doesn't capitalize on that like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th did by giving him a backstory. The other way they mess up is by barely having him in the movie. He's only in a few scenes. What the people making it failed to realize is that those scenes were the obvious highlights. The Bye Bye Man and his deformed dog that looks like it was pulled straight from the pits of hell are pretty cool looking and way spookier than some college student having visions about his GF and BFF hooking up behind his back."", ""The Bye Bye Man is simply a lot of wasted potential. It squanders it's main villain, puts nothing scary onscreen, and fundamentally misuses it's the few good ideas it does have. Now, there are plenty of bad horror movies out there. Ones that are lazily made, generic, and derivative like you wouldn't believe. The issue is often now that they are bad ideas, but that it's evident that the people involved just didn't really try. That's a frustrating thing to encounter, but not as frustrating as The Bye Bye Man. Here, the problem doesn't seem to be that nobody tried it's just that they had no idea what they were doing! I've rarely seen something so inept, so incompetent in execution. Never before has a trailer been so misleading. The movie needed to be more like that. Ergo, it needed to actually have the title villain in it! It's like people saw what they could have had here, but didn't know how to get it there. They took all the wrong paths and made a terrible movie. Just don't watch it."", ""3.5/10"" ]";0.0015421375161634885;

We've seen these kind of villains before. Lara Pulver is certainly sexy in a Eva Green sort of way, but her character's motives are as generic as they come. To top it all off all the fantasy mumbo-jumbo going on doesn't even make good use of vampire and werewolf lore. Everyone is just content to spend the entire movie talking about blood. But let's be honest, these movies were never really popular for their story. It was mostly for the vampire vs. werewolf action. It's kind of a lot of fun to watch monsters go toe-to-toe, so I can understand the original appeal. Plus it looked like some actual effort went into the originals. Blood Wars can't even deliver much on an action front either. I appreciate the movie's liberal use of gore. However this all by the numbers and plagued by cheap, dated special effects."", ""It's clear not much effort went into this. The budget either wasn't big or was severely misappropriated. It's content to have a half-hearted, very generic plot and subpar action. It does nothing to actually move the series forward. I imagine those who actually still follow the series could skip Blood Wars and just wait for the next one and miss absolutely nothing.

It does go a little beyond what it's predecessor did by upping the body count and by playing around with the rules of John Wick's world. The latter is especially significant because that's something a lot of fans asked for. The extra insight as to what makes life as an assassin tick is much appreciated."", ""There's a wonderful sense of style to the movie. It's an absolutely gorgeous film. The action is brought to life with spectacular, exciting set-pieces. There are plenty of inventive kills and as a result an almost constant stream of memorable moments.

What with the similar personalities, motives, and skill sets. It makes for some incredible fights. I believe they might have also upped the brutality here as well. Thrown in some extra blood. It makes things more exciting."", ""If there is one flaw to the action it's that the hand-to-hand combat falls back on the old 'watch our hero flip a guy by his arm' trick too often. Every time Wick finds himself without a gun that is always his fallback move. It's noticeable and a little weird. The gunplay however is flawless, fast, and furious. I can't think of another time where it's been this much fun watching people get shot in the head. There also may be an issue with the actual writing. Personally, I didn't notice this, but one person I know who watched it mentioned how it felt like they had seen it before because they could predict how everything was  going to play out in the final third of the film, right down to the dialog.

This sequel leans more on the comedy side of things, going for a more ridiculous and outright cartoonish tone. It loses a lot of the original's magic as a result. That being said, there's still plenty of enjoyment to be had here. The main issue with the movie is that the plot is so much weaker than anything the MCU has done in quite some time. Until the explosive, action-packed, and pretty emotional final act arrives the movie tends to sort of meander about with no clear idea of what it wants to be as James Gunn constantly moves from joke to joke. The humor itself is still largely funny, but a lot of it is surprisingly hit or miss. Gunn often tries to go with too many different styles of comedy. He tries to do too much and ends up doing not enough. The writing does succeed with the character Nebula though. Her arc is both the most emotional and the most compelling. It was what kept me most engaged in what was actually happening."", ""In an effort to make things bigger, better, and most obviously funnier the key elements that made the first such a treat and a breath of fresh air for the MCU get lost in the process.

Rather than diving into this absurdity and having some fun with things, director Afonso Poyart tries to go for self-serious and poignant. A pretty odd thing to do with in a movie about an old dude with psychic powers hunting down a serial killer. Plus the execution isn't quite there. Often when it tries to go for meaningful and intense, it just ends up embarrassing itself. Luckily though, not all of the fun from the core idea ends up process."", ""Like most movies that want to be something more, but ultimately just don't have the writing to back it up, Solace tries to trick audiences into thinking there's more going on underneath the surface with a flashy sense of style. Scenes carry that same artsy, overblown, and almost sterile feel and look to them that so many of this ilk use. The movie even looks pretentious. While this does lead to some cool looking moments, more often than not it's just unintentionally goofy and fails to carry the emotion Poyart was going for. It's style over substance. All flash and little to no bang. Anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job in the lead. No surprise there. He carries the movie until Colin Farrell shows up in the second-half and steals the show. Farrell's bizarre performance is the best part of the movie. So much so that he feels out of place amongst the rest of the cast. Of course that may not be saying much.

So really outside of our leads the only people you'll really be paying attention to are Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Abbie Cornish, who share the spotlight. While Cornish is just kind of there, Morgan ends up being just as likable as Hopkins and Farrell in his own ways.

Overly familiar, a little dumb, and it tries to be too serious and ends up with little to show for it. But darn if it doesn't have a (mostly) good cast. The biggest disappointment is that you can tell the people behind it were clearly trying to make something that deals with the complexity of how humans deal with the concepts of death, suffering, and loss, but ultimately just couldn't pull it off. Should have just stuck with some sci-fi, psychic fun. Oh well, not all it lost. It's still stupid fun in a lot of ways.

This is instead about Eckhart's character \""Dr. Ember's\"" quest for revenge against the entity that killed his family. The kid in question just happens to have the same demon up in his head. Everything else sort of falls to the side in favor of letting us know just what Dr. Ember is going through and what exactly happened that caused him to take on all these exorcisms in the first place. Everyone else is just there to serve as plot pieces. Eckhart is only one playing a real character. As a result there's no emotional connection to anything going on as basically everything else is just window-dressing for this man vs demon conflict and to act as an excuse to show off their admittedly neat science-fiction concepts.

In the end it falls short as a horror film as well. It's the kind of movie that tries a lot of different stuff at once, and ultimately pulls of none of them very well at all. As interesting as the idea is the execution is so lackluster one has to wonder why they bothered at all.

It's not just the voices either. Each person he plays feels fully fleshed out and unique from one another. Even little facial quirks are brought to life by him."", ""The tale itself seems to be a parable about human cruelty.

A shame, because had it gone this distance and really took a look at the actions of it's main character's actions, the questions it raises could have made this into something worthwhile. I mean, we get why the character has done what he's done, but the movie never challenges that. It just paints it as okay because we all would have done the same thing.

Just look at his movie \""Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor.\"" Actually, don't look at it. It's awful."", ""However, when it comes to humor Tyler Perry is actually pretty good. That's why it's been so refreshing to see more recent Madea films like Madea's Witness Protection and A Madea Christmas take on more lighthearted tones and focus on the laughs. Boo! is probably the most lighthearted yet. There's still some morals running in the back, but it's handled as lightly as possible so that the sweet parts are pushed to the front and the more uncomfortable ones are cut out completely. So the question remains, is Boo! funny? Yes, in face it is. Maybe even much more so than you would expect. The jokes come about a mile a minute. The majority of them hit their mark even if the movie has a tendency to rely on characters just saying the same thing repeatedly with in their characters weird voices. For those who watch Madea movies as a family, I think it's worth mentioning this is probably the crudest Madea I've seen thus far. I'll admit that I've only watched a few of these movies and it's been a while since I have. However, I don't remember them having this much profanity at this level. Not as many innuendos either.

Based on the 2013 reimagining series that ran on Disney XD, \""Max Steel\"" is another entry in the ever-growing superhero film market that is currently being dominated by the comic book bigshots Marvel and DC. Max Steel is an admirable attempt at getting another series going, but was ultimately doomed to be DOA due to the fact that it's a more obscure character and clearly just didn't have the flash or history of it's competition. That's not to say it's all bad though. In fact, Max Steel can be quite entertaining. It's just that a reliance on formula holds it back. It's pretty much your standard superhero origin story. You can see bits of Raimi's Spider-Man as Max McGrath plays around with his newly discovered powers, the plot itself is derivative of those two Amazing Spider-Man movies, and the villain feels like he was pulled straight from 2008's Iron Man. It's a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas tied together with the character's own original lore, which I must say is surprisingly well-handled in that you get an answer to all your questions by the end of the film. Further explanation as to the reasoning behind those explanations, like what actually causes Max's weird powers in the first place isn't something the movie gets into. Oh, so he's filled with Tachyon energy. Why? Because aliens? Okay I guess. The writing is just lacking a little something needed to stand up amongst it's very successful peers."", ""The action scenes in the movie are fine and the characters themselves are pretty likable. Even believable. Particularly Max himself. Ben Winchell does a great job in the lead role. The dialog itself is surprisingly great as well. The interactions between characters feel real right up until some cheesy dialog during the final showdown. It's this kind of stuff that kept me engaged and entertained even though the movie isn't exactly the next great superhero epic. Even Max's personal dramas of loneliness and an absent father are relatable in a way that this year's Power Ranger's movie was. Luckily, this movie is much better in the action department. The humorous dialog from Josh Brener as \""Steel\"" is also much appreciated."", ""Overall, Max Steel isn't as bad as a lot of movie based on toys have been. It by no means soars to new heights, but can at least prove to be a suitable way to pass the time between the next Marvel and DC film if you really find yourself needing your superhero fix. It should come as no surprise though that the real audience for this movie are the kids who enjoyed the Disney XD show. They'll have a blast watching their once animated hero brought to life in live-action form in his own feature film. Parents and older siblings might even find themselves enjoying it too.

He takes things to another level and the movie goes to show his outstanding ability as an actor. He's not the only notable person onscreen though. While everyone else is pretty much playing the standard character roles one would expect in this kind of movie, there is Danny McBride really stepping out of his comedic comfort zone in favor of a surprisingly emotional performance. After Fassbender he is the next best person onscreen."", ""Covenant proves to be a welcome return to form Ridley Scott and the Alien series he created. It builds on the groundwork laid by Prometheus, leading to much better results and continues the story of it masterfully. This is the Alien prequel we've been waiting for. If the writing has one flaw it's that the big twist at the end is totally predictable. I would also say that the big finale relies a bit too much on action over horror, but overall those complaints are minor in comparison to everything else going on. Bloody good fun and surprisingly deep to boot, Alien: Covenant is not to be missed, longtime Alien fans or newcomers alike."" ]";0.15962773998488286;

Yet, Flanagan has some great tricks up his sleeve to make it more than your average jump scare fest. The tone is suitably creepy and bizarre moments are around every corner to set viewers on edge. Of course the real strength in this department comes from the young Lulu Wilson. Her performance is astounding. Better than a lot of actors and actresses who have been in the game for years. She's creepy, sweet, and demented. Perfectly capable of playing both adorable little angel and deformed, vile demon all in the same film. She is what's so creepy about things."", ""I am able to forgive the lack of fright thanks to both the movie's ingenuity and well-written plot. Struggling families are nothing new to horror films, but rarely these days are their struggles so well realized. We witness genuinely fleshed out characters that are backed up by great performances. Little touches of humor and heart add believability to the situation. The set up about these characters running a scam about being able to contact the dead in order to just get by, and then coming across real trouble when they are actually able to make contact is a great one. It's also a very effective prequel tale that ties into it's (awful) predecessor nicely. I don't recommend watching that movie to see for yourself though. Just stick with this one."", ""A perfect example of how something good can come out of something really, really bad. At least when the situation is in the right hands that is.

It may be lacking in actual scares, but it certainly tries harder than the average flick in the genre that hits the screen these days. Give it a shot.

You'll notice influences from a lot of other genres outside of the standard comic book movie affair.

This is without a doubt the most diverse comic book movie thus far."", ""It's going to be interesting to see where the X-Men movies go from here. There's plenty of potential to go forward in new ways as well as a new middle chapter to flesh out thanks to the still game-changing effects of Days of Future Past. The difference now is that they are going to have to move forward without Hugh Jackman, which should mean no Wolverine as well (who wants to follow that act?). A pretty big challenge to overcome given that even the movies that weren't stand-alones were very Wolverine-centric. So long as the people behind these movies can keep things as unique and well-executed as this movie, then they'll be okay. Regardless, our last outing with Wolverine (at least with Hugh Jackman in the role) is a grand one.

Actually seeing what these people are talking about be played out onscreen with the director's oh so playfully sadistic approach to horror is just unnerving."", """", ""So yeah, the documentary angle falls short. Director Rodney Ascher's focus is definitely on the horror. He's using these people's stories to scare the audience. That might sound exploitive, but Ascher himself has experienced this. He's not just trying to use the scares to cash in on other people's real life terror.

When things finally get going it's almost enough to make you forget about how bad everything else is. It's even quite fun at times. The hits themselves Statham is forced to pull of are quite exciting and inventive. Near the end it starts to rely on formulaic shoot outs, but at least that's better than the writing. Plus you're treated to some gorgeous scenery. Of course even that gets hurt by some bad green screen and CGI work here and there. There are times where you can clearly see the budget restraints. The direction also seems a tad amateurish. Did we really need those lengthy fade to blacks before the next scene? At times though this is actually a strength. It (unintentionally) harkens back to those cheesy action hits of the 80's. When it comes to action movies there are plenty of better alternatives out there. However there are also plenty of worse ones as well. But why waste your time with something so middling?

These entity tormenting these characters isn't very frightening in appearance and results to the same hide, seek, and pop out tactics from time to time that we see all of the time. There are inventive scenarios, but this is more of a thriller and less of a horror movie. The story itself isn't bad. It uses a believable scenario to ensure that these characters come together.

There's some pretty impressive lore here as to what a clown actually is and why wearing this particular clown suit is having this effect. The movie also has a much appreciated sense of humor about itself. There are moments that poke fun at the craziness of the situation. Unfortunately, what it fails to deliver on if any really effective horror."", ""Most of what the movie has to offer is just having viewers look at pictures of clowns that have been overly creepified.

Even if it's mostly just due to the fact that he bares a striking resemblance to old Pennywise. As the more monstrous qualities of the change come into play, the clown starts to look a little overdone. Kind of robbing it's appearance of the more subtle creepiness by moving into full-blown monster flick territory. The real problem is that director and co-writer Jon Watts is unable to instill any kind of fear or tension into his scenes. For example, my favorite scene in the movie takes place in one of those jungle gym playgrounds that used to be at every McDonald's back in the day. It's a pretty cool, playful, and creepy setting for a kid to run into a killer clown. Unfortunately, the only payoff was another one of the movie's dull jump scares. Watts never capitalizes on the film's potential. The result is a movie that feels flat and lifeless in comparison to other horror flicks."", ""Clown is good at having some fun with itself and coming up with an interesting take on clown lore. The transformation has some interesting qualities before becoming too overblown in the final act. I also have to give the movie credit for having the guts (pun intended) to show kids getting killed in violent and gory ways. So ultimately there is some value here, it's just that the execution falls short so we end up with something that lacks effectiveness in inspiring fear or genuine interest. In fact I found that the most compelling part of the movie is just how many comparisons I was able to draw between it and the two adaptations of the classic Stephen King story. Jon Watts just doesn't prove himself as a director who is good at horror. Maybe it was just the budget, but who knows. As it stands Clown isn't without some merits and is ultimately watchable.

It follows the book of Revelations pretty closely and is much more interesting than the bland love triangle or the newly-weds sappy love (this is set at a wedding BTW). Those aspects fall short because of how lame the characters are.

Which is something I believe the genre has struggled with in it's more recent movie ventures. It all succeeds thanks to it's likable lead and supporting cast. Obviously though there are some pretty big issues. As almost always with movies that are based off books, there are some pretty important details missing. Details that would have otherwise made it easier to get fully invested in the movie. For instance what's up with the issue of a third child in the movies universe? It's mentioned that \""a third\"" could be considered an embarrassment and you need permission to have one, but we are never told why. Also the obvious complexities with Ender's relationship with his various family members are never explored, which left me feeling like I was missing something throughout the entire movie. I imagine the book touches on these things, I do not know as I have not read it, but just keep in mind not everything is as well explained as it should be.

carrie;7;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""Probably the biggest change in this remake is that it's set in modern times. The movie does a fairly good job of taking advantage of this. For example part of the torment Carrie's classmates put her through involves cyberbullying. It's a small new addition that is only mentioned in one or two scenes because the era source material fits in doesn't really make much room for new additions. Some of the book and original movie's dialog can still be found here and not all of it fits in well with the new time period. 2013's Carrie attempts to add some new elements do fall short here and there because of how closely it sticks to the original's formula, which was a fairly faithful adaption of the book in the first place."", """", ""Those of us who experienced the original movie will notice the many similarities. The remake does a better job of following that movie than it does the book itself.

While still pretty identical to the first Carrie, director Kimberly Peirce does add her own twists to the familiar scenes. Not all of which are all that great."", """", ""At times it feels too modern and too aimed at todays youthful demographic. It's pretty, flashy, and filled with attractive young actors and actresses.

That's without a doubt the movie's biggest issue."", """", ""Chloë Grace Moretz is without a doubt a fantastic young actress. She's just not really the right choice for Carrie. Despite her best efforts to look as socially awkward and sheltered, she comes off as way too natural and confident. Perhaps it's believable that she wouldn't be the high-school's most popular student, but she's nowhere near backwards enough to be the most hated and bullied girl in the halls. There are moments where she's just awkward enough to come off as believable, but that's only when they are sticking to the original movie's scenes precisely."", """", ""Yet, when the fateful prom scene finally hits, something about Moretz blood soaked appearance that's just menacing and deranged.

When she washes off that blood though, we're back to not so believable Carrie."", """", ""So how about the famous prom scene? While it doesn't have the original's restraint and (broken) heart, it makes up for it in flash and some satisfyingly brutal revenge. Peirce does a great job of making sure we see Carrie's demons laid to rest as the she dishes back out the cruelty her bullies unfairly placed upon her. Things get really violent and over-the-top. It's incredibly satisfying to watch even if it does go too big."", """", ""While nowhere near as good as the 1976 adaption and especially not the book itself, 2013's Carrie still succeeds. That's more a testament to Stephen King's writing than a praise to Peirce's take on the classic. To be brutally honest most of her changes just aren't very good. Carrie is just an inherently excellent story to begin with."", """", ""That's not to say all the changes are bad. If there's one thing I will give this new adaption credit for it's on the way it portrays Carrie's relationship with her mother. There's actually some love there. Yes, the themes of religious intolerance and abuse still ooze from the Margaret White character, but you can see in this version she actually does love her daughter. An element missing from the book and previous adaption where she was just cruel to Carrie all the way through. It makes for a more believable dynamic, even if it makes the story as a whole less heartbreaking."", """", ""The tale of Carrie White is still better experienced by reading the book or watching the 1976 classic, but this is still a good adaption. Carrie should have been better cast and it's missing out on some the gut punch from the book and the original that made them so emotionally effective. It's a little too modernized to be as effective, especially where the horror is concerned. Yet, Stephen King knocked it out of the park when he wrote this one. That brilliance still shines through in this take on the story. Not too mention, that prom scene is more exciting than ever.

hauntinginconnecticut;5;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""There's a decent little story at the core of this movie. The family drama primarily deals with a family's struggle when one of their kids is diagnosed with cancer. The strongest aspect is definitely the mother's love and strength while dealing with her son's ever-worsening condition. It tries some other stuff like the grief-ridden alcoholic father angle, but the rest of it is underdeveloped. Even the 'barely scrapping by' element gets lost at some point. Strong performances make up for the fact that this is barely above Lifetime original movie quality in terms of production. You can tell there wasn't much money funneled into this. What really holds The Haunting in Connecticut back is that it's so generic as a horror movie. Every trick it has up it's sleeve has been seen elsewhere countless times before. Never before has a house filled with dead people felt so lifeless. Far from the first horror movie to boast that it's \""based on a true story,\"" the plot here serves as an example of why not many people actually believe in this stuff. First off the supposed actual events themselves have been met with much scrutiny. I doubt this movie, which supposedly deviates even farther from reality than the book, will do anything to persuade people otherwise. You can literally see in every scene how the family could have faked the entire thing. The way any and all evidence to support their claims was lost at the end of the movie is all too convenient. The extra added monologue where the mother character says that doesn't she doesn't care whether the audience believes her or not because she knows what happened only makes it harder to take any of it seriously.

The problem is that it just doesn't deliver any frights."", ""As entertaining as it to watch Cooper's slow descent into madness, it's not hard to see that there just isn't much going on in these scenes. The film juxtaposes in some bloodier moments before it's carnage filled final act, but when it's more interesting to watch the main character snap pictures than it is to watch the film's big baddie chop people up, your horror film might have a problem. The issue with these scenes is that the tone isn't what it should be. I can deal with the overly special effects driven gore, but I can't deal with how oddly tongue-in-cheek these moments feel. It clashes with the more serious tone the rest of the movie has. The problem is that it goes for silly and ridiculous when it should be serious and scary. At the very least the movie treats us to some stomach-churning, at times gross out gore. Yet, even then the over-the-top nature of things takes away some of the effect."", ""Yet, for what it lacks as a slasher flick it almost makes up for with it's mystery. There's some weird stuff going on that pulls you in the same way it pulls in our protagonist. Just like Cooper's character, you'll find yourself strangely hooked and desperate for answers. There's a bit of a solid payoff in the final act if you stick around. Mostly due to an out-there reveal and solid action. The ending is quite cliché though.

Certainly one of the more original horror flicks I've watched in quite some time. Honestly, I can't really think of anything quite like it. It's one of those rare horror flicks where the story and characters are actually more compelling than the actual horror. It's just a shame things can get too absurd for their own good.

This movie ultimately doesn't reach the same heights as a del Toro movie as it ends up diving too much into gothic melodrama. At least it's a very pretty film that looks different than the vast majority of horror movies out there. It does have a strange made-for-TV vibe going for it though. It's shot in a weird soap opera style and the performances are a little basic with the exception of Idris Elba who is the highlight of the film. This all does make sure the movie is certainly original and interesting because of that, but it does little on the quality front."", ""By far the most disappointing aspect of the movie outside of it's lack of narrative focus is that it really doesn't have anything to say about religious faith. You'll see characters who are Christian, and these are definitely Biblical plagues going on, but outside of that first plague that kicks things off, the movie sort of leaves God in the backseat until the end as a way of giving some sort of explanation for all the weirdness happening in this small town. The rest of the plagues are just there to try and give you the heebie-jeebies by being strange.

hostel-part-ii;7;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""Roth's revisiting of the Hostel concept follows largely the same outline as the original. However, Part II has more going for it than just a gender swap with the protagonists. Roth took the time focus more on the elements that worked in the first film, and less on the ones that didn't. He also ups the gore and violence while simultaneously giving us more insight as to how exactly the whole Hostel situation works. The scale is larger and things are a little more brutal this time around, but there's no hiding the fact that it's not as original and loses the mystery in favor of more visual horror. Think of it as more like a remake where some improvements were made."", ""The fact that we know what's going on this time around should have robbed the movie of some of what made it successful the first time around. However, it's Roth's ability to the ante that keeps things solid. With more of torture taking place onscreen the movie goes for a more sleazy route in entertainment. The blood is gratuitous, the deaths are twisted, and the grimier visual style and environments is very reminiscent of the Saw series. Essentially Part II really embraces the \""torture porn\"" angle. There is something kind of sick about that, but Roth keeps things from being too morally revolting by including some dark humor that helps keep things lighter and more playful. Because of that it never crosses into that realm of almost being a straight snuff film."", ""I appreciated how this time around the humor was kept more around the gallows as opposed to the gutter. There's still nudity and some sex, but this is far from the raunchy sex comedy it's predecessor was. The girls are still up for a party, but their far less obnoxious that the frat bros we previously hung out with. It makes them more likable, even if the main is that perfect pretty girl who everything works out for no matter what the situation apparently. Leaner and meaner, Hostel proves worth revisiting in Part II. Roth trimmed the fat from the first movie and loves letting this sequel flex it's new muscles with some more violent scenes and a little more insight as to how the whole setup works. It's still a little bare bones in the actual plot department and some scenes are still a little slow, but at the end of the day this is still one of those rare movie sequels that's an actual improvement on the original. Something made possible because of how much more gruesome and to the point it is. Roth cut the crap and focused on the action. Now if only he could make something a little more substantial.

Whether or not that's a good thing just comes to down to your tastes. The actual torture is brief and muted.

You're going to have to put up with some frat boy humor and a dull mid-section, but by far the most disappointing aspect of the film is that Eli Roth never takes us back to those 70's era exploitation film levels of gratuity that he's so well-known for.

The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit."", ""While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other.

Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today.

There's simply too much lollygagging through the Uzumaki's opening chapters."", ""That's really the problem with the movie. It just drags it's feet so much that it never really manages to get to the more twisted moments from Junji Ito's horror masterpiece. Director Higuchinsky is obsessed with his camera angles.

The moments from the manga he is able to use do look pretty great. You just don't get to see as many of them as you would like."", ""The reason for that is the pacing is painfully slow at times. There are so many scenes where things are drawn out to the point where nothing is happening. The movie dives into moments where it incorporates it's own subplots in. While I appreciate the added depth to Kirie and Shuichi's relationship, was there really any reason to include the time wasting new character Tamura the reporter? Initially his inclusion looked promising as he was being used as the movie's attempt to add some sort of explanation to the spiral curse. That ends up never happening though.

Both a good and a bad thing. While it means there's even less of the manga we get to see brought to life, it actually ends up being the movie's freakiest moment. Given that this is a horror film it's worth noting that this isn't a scary movie. It's just really weird and occasionally shows some deranged imagery. It's ultimately the kind of movie that's really only going to appeal to fans of the manga. Even then it's kind of a mixed bag. I got a kick out of seeing some of the more memorable moments onscreen, but the original stuff and at times frustrating slow pace got in the way of my enjoyment. For those unfamiliar with Junji Ito's Uzumaki, one can perhaps still find enjoyment in the shear originality, unique camera angles, and bizarre visuals, but the slow pacing and shear oddness are likely to get in the way.

It's about growth. About finding out who you are, coming out of your shell, standing up for yourself and discovering what you are willing to fight for. Oh, and it's about falling in love."", ""The thing holding the movie together is Adam Sandler's incredible performance as \""Barry.\"" The movie really shows why Sandler should step out of his box more. He even outshines the incredibly talented and critically acclaimed director behind the whole thing. Dare I say it, if Paul Thomas Anderson had tried to make this movie with anyone else other than Sandler, the results probably wouldn't have been this good. It would have been harder to overlook the nonsensical moments the director throws in or his intentionally cheap, amateurish camera work (most evident in the way it pans the screen). All of which feels kind of pretentious. The remarkable thing is that none of this really feels all that far out of Sandler's wheelhouse. It's not the majority of the stuff he's been in hasn't had him playing as a character with anger problems before. The difference is that the material here is just deeper and requires more range from him. It's amazing that more people aren't taking advantage of this. That they can't see what Anderson saw in him. I don't blame other people in Hollywood kind of losing faith in him and not wanting to give him a chance based on all those critically panned comedies he's made over the years. Especially lately where even as a fan I have to admit he hasn't been trying as hard as he used to. Still, it's not as though he hasn't come out of his comfort zone following this. He's shown he can rise to the occasion for more serious material in film's like Reign Over Me or Spanglish, among others. Come one people, throw the man a bone. He's still got it in him to deliver movies like this."", ""Punch-Drunk Love proves to be a meaningful, romantic, and at times outright hilarious dark comedy that features an outstanding performance from an actor who most people wouldn't and still don't think is capable of one. The movie even manages to get it out of him while playing to a few of his expected strengths in the process. Simply put, the movie gives one of cinema's biggest critical punching bags some good material from a proven director and lets us watch him rise to the occasion. Sandler even elevates to something even more special as a result. Highly recommended."" ]";0.16407884465261513;

It may not stand alongside the best of either's work, but it's got good performances, a neat tale to tell, and a few chills along the way. All in all, that makes for a good horror movie.

His character is one of the best parts. Simultaneously funny and someone you can root for. Samuel Jackson is excellent as always. This may not seem like the kind of movie where he would be allowed to flex his acting muscles, but he is given one of his more memorable monologues here. It serves as a reminder of just how talented he is at commanding the screen and taking hold of the viewers attention. Essentially, it's another reminder of why Jackson is one of the greats. It Thomas Jane who steals the show though by nailing the does-everything action hero role and adding some masculine sex appeal to the mix. He's all around awesome and Deep Blue Sea stands out as one of his best movies/roles."", ""The plot may be a bit absurd, but stands to give viewers a great setting for underwater mishaps. Renny Harlin knows how to craft tension in his scenes. It's more than just sharks causing these characters problems. Their sea-based facility proves to be a crumbling death trap.

pet-sematary;7;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""A very faithful adaptation of the novel. It's an almost scene-for-scene recreation of the book's story. I enjoyed seeing my favorite moments from it being brought to life before my very eyes. There are a few minor differences in dialog here and there, and the character Victor Pascow is given a larger role, but the only big change comes from the removal of Jud Crandall's wife. Her role in the story has been given instead to the maid, Missy Dandridge. With the screenplay having been written by Stephen King himself, you can tell this decision was made just so there would be a difference between the book and movie that's a little more distinguishable than the rest. Something more significant to possibly encourage people to check out both versions of the fiction. It ultimately effects very little. The fidelity to the source material guarantees that this movie is sure to be a hit with fans of the novel. The level of success it will find among those who have not read the Stephen King story is more up to question."", ""When I watched the movie I tried to do so from two perspectives; one as a fan of the book, and one as an outsider who never picked up a copy. While the fan in me was mostly pleased, the part of me that had to view it with out any knowledge of what happened in the book was a little more critical of the flaws. It's not hard to notice how flatly acted the whole thing is. Not hard at all. Our lead Dale Midkiff is the worst offender. He's far too wooden and lifeless. Former sitcom star Fred Gwynne feels a bit too suited for comedy to play a truly great Jud Crandall. In the final act though he really shapes up and shows some true emotion. There are also some poor decisions made with some scenes that rob them of their potential creepiness. For example a few scenes include interactions between a grown man and an obviously lifeless mannequin/doll. These issues could have been in part the fault of either time or budget constraints. Maybe both. Then there's the fact that the movie sort of rushes through the plot of the book. It jumps from major event to major event at occasionally jarring speeds. Never sticking around long enough to really sell the horror or capture the emotions that were on display in the novel. All of these were things that could have handled better if the movie had been in the hands of a better director. I get that there was a lot of material to cover, but some of these mistakes feel amateurish in nature."", ""Still, the movie has it's creepy moments in it's final act and some of the more potent themes from the book manage to still find their way in here as well. It's even got some pretty great gore effects. So there's still a chance it may appeal to the less literary-inclined out there. And as I've said before, those who have read the book this movie is based on are practically guaranteed to find at least a small level of enjoyment here for the faithfulness alone. Even if they too find it to be unintentionally funny at times or not quite so well-executed in some areas. As it stands, this is definitely among the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel in the exactness department.

They make real decisions and act like a real family. Elements of the film make it part horror-comedy because of how realistically it portrays how people act. It makes it easy to get involved in their plight. You'll actually care about these characters, unlike the faceless morons you'll find in today's horror films."", """", ""The second is originality. Even today after all these years there is still nothing like it. A trend I've noticed a lot with the old horror classics. Some would say we don't see horror films like this anymore due to the progression of time leading to new forms of style being needed for the genre. I disagree. There is a sense of imagination to the scenes that we don't see anymore. Crazy crap happens here that blows all of the lame jump scares and similar looking specters that plague the horror flicks of today out of the water. Not too mention the themes it tackles. Something the vast majority of more modern horror movies don't do at all."", """", ""A return of this style of horror movie would be most welcome.

This may sound like a stupid complaint, especially since the genre is very commonly criticized for not doing that, but I've never seen so much work go into building up characters this unlikable.

There's lite talk of the balance between science and mythology, superstitions, and peaks into scientific analysis among other things. However these elements are only mentioned in passing.

There's still some fun to be had here in it's final act when it gets to the stuff you showed up for in the first place.

The ending is different and nowhere near as explosive (literally) as the one in the book, and you'll also likely notice some different takes on a few characters as well. Yet, little of what made that tale so powerful gets lost in the move to the big-screen. The heartbreaking nature of the events are expertly captured and Sissy Spacek is a darn-near perfect Carrie despite being as skinny as a rail post (in the book the character is a touch overweight). She carries the heart and sole of the character with her awkward, sympathetic, and ultimately powerful performance. The movie is sure to strike a chord with anyone who has ever been bullied. It also serves as one of the best anti-bullying messages there is. No, not because Carrie eventually has her revenge on all those who tormented her. Instead it is because of the ability the story has to make us feel what Carrie feels. Her loneliness, hurt, fear, and embarrassment are channeled into the viewer thanks to Spacek. Her performance has the power to express what the character is going through beneath the surface almost as well as the words on the pages on the novel do. It's incredible stuff and makes the final act all the more riveting and crushing as we watch Carrie rise only to be let down again."", ""As a horror movie it is both beautifully shot and not very frightening.

I never cared about what was going on, the characters failed to grab me in any way, and outside of the occasional cool action scene this movie ended up being a waste of time. It's all so disappointing because this was supposed to bring Super Man back with a new tone. If this is how the rest of the Super Man movies are going to turn out they need to just stop now. It even makes me worry that, if one ever gets made, the future Justice League movie will fail."" ]";0.05304608585858588;

Still I came into this movie to watch Arnold (not even going to try to spell his last name XD), my all-time favorite action star, kill some dudes, and the movie delivers on that front.

That being said the movie does have some flaws that get in the way of the fright. For one there are a lot of unintentional funny moments in this movie (the bird scene is hilarious XD), and I always hate when horror movies focus on things like family drama, which unfortunately this movie does. But when the movie is focusing all of its power and freaking you out with its mystery the movie is enjoyable and makes up for its duller moments. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, especially considering how stupid the trailers looked and how recent horror movies I've watched have not scared me at all. But Dark Skies proved to be the exception, providing some nice scares. I recommend this to any horror fans out there. It's really unique and we need more movies like it.

Other Tyler Perry films, including the Madea ones, can sometimes get too serious and dark in this department. Quite frankly the problem with that is that Tyler Perry just hasn't been very good at handling that sort of thing. His movies sometimes overindulge in depictions human cruelty. They all end on a better, more happy note for the characters, but the dark drama still clashes awkwardly with Madea's brand of humor. Thankfully this Christmas flick keeps things pretty light."", ""The family values are in place and it even delivers a nice little message about the evils of racism. It's sweet in that oh so cheesy Hallmark way. If you know Madea then you know what to expect from the humor.

Simply ask yourself, \""Did I like other Madea movies?\"" If the answer is yes, you should very well like this one. If not, then this won't be the one to win you over. However if you've never watched a Madea movie before, what you need to know is that you're walking into something that feels like a TV movie. One that is a funny and pretty warm option for Christmas.

Yes this is another superhero movie with a little too much going on. It's trying hard to do it's own thing while setting up a larger universe and cramming in fan service along the way. It's the kind of thing that killed two of Spider-Man's movie series. Sometimes superhero movies just do too much and as a result cause elements to flow together unevenly and hurt the overall film. Batman v Superman unfortunately doesn't escape this. However thanks to excellent depictions of both of it's title heroes and some original ideas along the way the movie still has a chance to please."", """", ""One particularly controversial new idea is the movie's depiction of Lex Luther. Jesse Eisenberg plays a much different version of the character than what has been seen before in movies and even the comics. He's an eccentric, crazy kid with a God complex. Not everyone is likely to enjoy this unique interpretation of the character as I did. Some are even likely to find him annoying (some bad lines here and there and goofy delivery don't help), but I for one thought this version of Lex was more entertaining than any comic or previous movie version of him.

Definitely fitting the comic book character. However it's not always easy to pick up on that as he is outshined by Ben Affleck as Batman.

As far as the rest of the cast goes, there isn't really anyone noteworthy to talk about. The only other character that really gets any screen time is Amy Adams' Louise Lane and she's really boring. It's hardly any fault of Adams. Her character is just so lame here."", """", ""Outside of nailing it's heroes, the movie really succeeds in the action department. It's exciting and violent. Snyder does rely on explosions and the final portion of the film does devolve into visual noise, but I more than entertained by it. The brutal fight scenes stay true to the characters and are a blast to watch. So much so that the movie stumbles when blows aren't being exchanged."", """", ""The story itself is solid, but tries way too hard to be deep and meaningful. The movie suffers when it tries to be something more than a superhero slugfest. Sadly, that's kind of something it tries a lot. It ends up being heavy-handed at times and cheesy at it's worst."", """", ""Another one of the big issues with the movie is Doomsday. This villain feels shoehorned it right when the movie should have ended. It feels like an unnecessary inclusion that doesn't really do the character or the movie justice. It makes sense that this would have taken place later on in the DC cinematic universe and doesn't really fit in well with the events of this movie. Oh well. At least we get some pretty cool action that pulls Wonder Woman into the fight and an ending for one of the characters that I didn't see coming."", """", ""So yes, Batman v Superman is flawed and perhaps not the best way to kick of a cinematic universe. That being said the satisfying depictions of the heroes, decent (if overly packed) plot, and cool new ideas do still make it worth a watch.

Chappie is lovable in every way, and as far as I'm concerned, one of the most endearing characters in cinema history. Sharlto Copley's performance as him deserves to be praised.

The rest of the cast is fantastic at playing their lovably oddball characters. Yolandi Visser in particular stands out as the second best character in the film after Chappie himself.

Unfortunately Dev Patel feels underutilized despite his character actually creating Chappie (he goes pushed aside for most of the film), and Sigourney Weaver's presence is barely noticed. Still, the cast is fantastic all around and it's hard to not love or enjoy their characters even if some of them are villains."", """", ""The film also owes a lot to it's unique style.

It may give too little explanation as to the more sci-fi elements going on to appeal to the more casual audience, but those familiar with the source material should have no problem knowing what's going on."", ""Then there's the part of the story that takes place in the past. Where the conflict between Assassins and Templars is at it's most action packed. Usually it's also where it's at it's most interesting as well. That isn't so much the case here. That's because it's Assassin protagonists aren't really characters and more just vehicles to deliver the action. We know nothing about them and there isn't really much of a story happening in this time period. We do get some stellar visuals though and the Assassins act like Assassins. They rely on some nice tactics and tools from the games to make things more believable. While there are plenty of fight scenes and exciting, acrobatic chases, they do rely on some stealth moments before all of this happens so that they feel like true assassins."", ""Now most of what I've said here probably sounds like a dream come true for Assassin's Creed fans. That's because in a lot of ways this movie is. It is not however a perfect movie. The action is a key example of this. While often exciting, it does suffer from overactive camera work. Shots jump around so much during the fighting that it's hard to actually see what's going on. For every cool moment there's about three or so where things are just a visual mess. The tendency to jump back in forth through time to see future/present Fassbender doing the same things as his ancestor in the past is also an annoyance. I get the idea. It's a way to show off how the new Animus works, but they could have done this once or twice the first time it's being used instead of continuing this trick throughout the entire movie. It's much more interesting to watch the Assassin ancestor fight real people than it is to watch Fassbender swat at shadows in the present day."", ""The rest of the issues the movie has are only really going to affect people unfamiliar with the games. An flaw that is both fortunate and unfortunate in it's own ways. Non-fans are likely going to be confused by the sci-fi side of things which forgoes explanations here and there, as well as the lack of story for the Assassin's conflicts in the past. These also have the potential to annoy fans as well, but they are more likely to be forgiving towards them given how faithful this adaption is to the games."", ""For Assassin's Creed fans this is a must see. Never before has a video game series been so lovingly captured and portrayed in movie form. Nearly every element of the series from it's conception back in 2007 with the first game is in place for the movie. The original tale captures even the series forgotten or mistreated ones. Those who don't play the games or just never liked are likely to find less enjoyment here. However what made the games so popular still has the potential here to draw people in."", ""7.7/10"" ]";0.1356105131105131;
xxx-return-of-xander-cage;6;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""What the heck did I just watch? The first xXx was a spy movie aimed at the teenage male audience. Explosions, extreme sports, and over glorification of video games and masculinity with attitude. This sequel sees the return of Vin Diesel in the starring role. Yet, this is a very different movie than the one he was in way back in 2002. Apparently the people behind the movie wanted to make things as gonzo as possible this time around. It has one the most bizarre tones I have ever witnessed in a movie. Things get so ludicrous you really have no idea what to expect at any given moment."", ""The action scenes are really the only thing that feel like the first xXx. Watching Diesel skateboard and motorbike his way through gunfire and pull off implausible stunts hearken back to the movie that started this series. Even then though this film goes even more over-the-top. Even when it's unbelievable as heck, it's an absolute blast to watch the bullets fly, cars crash, and whatever other crazy crap the movie has in store for us, which is quite a bit."", ""The plot is an absolute sugar rush. Xander Cage puts together a team of other xXx members and sets off to retrieve Pandora's Box, a device that causes satellites to crash from orbit, and avenge the death of a friend. The ensemble cast comes together great. Obviously Diesel gets the spotlight, but the other members of his team are given plenty of chances to shine. This is something last year's Suicide Squad movie could have taken note from. There are actually a lot of characters in this movie. Cage interacts with various contacts who just sort of come and go with little idea as to how they know each other. The plot itself is ridiculous. It features so many people changing sides and moves at a breakneck pace. It's all done with a tongue-in-cheek style that carries over into the dialog. It revels in it's own goofiness. This leads to a sense of unpredictability that's unlike any other action movie I've watched. You half-expect it to have laser sharks at a moments notice. It doesn't, but if it did you wouldn't bat an eye. Things are certainly dumb, but at least you'll never be bored."", ""The acting in this isn't the strongest. Surprisingly Diesel himself feels the most out of place. His age really shows here. He seems too old to be playing this skateboarding, trash talking, tattooed wise-cracker. So like for the first hour or so every attempt to make him seem cool just ends up being kind of dorky. Xander Cage is more personable this time around, and Diesel is just better at playing more reserved action heroes. You eventually get used to it though and Diesel slip into the role better. Of course I may have too busy watching in disbelief at all of the crazy crap happening around him."", ""One of the most absurd, crazy movies I have ever watched. Complete with subpar acting and dialog so bad you can't help but love it. The movie knows it's low-grade schlock though and has a lot of fun with that fact. As a result viewers can as well if they let themselves just get lost with the madness of what they are watching. The people behind this had to be clinically insane to even come up with half of this stuff. None of this changes the fact that it's not really a \""good\"" movie. Just one that hasn't got a dull moment. For me, that makes it kind of a guilty pleasure. The kind of movie I like in spite of myself and could actually see myself watching again. Who knows, maybe you'll feel the same way. If you aren't the type to have brainless fun though, don't even bother. 6.2/10"" ]";0.02619791666666666;
finding-dory;10;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""I, like many, was apprehensive about the idea of a sequel to the Pixar masterpiece Finding Nemo. It didn't really seem like there was room for a sequel in the universe, and with the exception of their Toy Story series Pixar has left me disappointed with it's sequels. However, while Finding Dory is definitely not as good as it's predecessor, it is a welcome return to the aquatic side of Pixar movies."", ""First off it's a stunning reminder of how perfect the original is in terms of animation, characters, and casting. Dory and the gang are just how you remember them and the voice acting is still some of the most incredible I have ever experienced. The cast adds nuance and life to these characters using only their voices. The animation is nothing short of gorgeous. Things like returning characters and references serve as humorous and appreciated throwbacks to the original."", ""All that said, this isn't one of those sequels that reuses plot elements and jokes from the first movie to get by. It stands on it's own as an incredible animated movie. One with it's own adventure, new characters, and plenty of original humor and heart."", ""Just like the best of Pixar's work, Finding Dory is emotional and heartwarming. The character of Dory is front and center with a stunning core performance from Ellen DeGeneres that quite frankly deserves every voice acting award out there. Now the plot itself does get a little absurd. Characters bounce around through situations that often defy logic. Honestly, I'm okay with that. Because at the end of the day it's still entertaining and you can feel it in your heart. You can also feel it in your funny bone, because it's absolutely hilarious. Simply put, Finding Dory is another masterpiece from Pixar. No, it's not as good as Finding Nemo, but honestly that kind of lighting doesn't strike twice. Instead it's a very respectable follow up that will enchant families and viewers of all ages. And at the end of the day, it still blows away just about everything else out there."" ]";0.33509199134199136;
raw;9;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""College is an interesting time in the life of any young person. For many it's where people truly discover who they are, and usually not without some difficulty. That's what I found the heart of Raw to be. A coming of age story where a girl must find out how to live for the first time upon awakening to her true self. However, her awakening isn't a sexual one like so many other films would have done. Sure, there are moments where she experiences the pangs of lust, but for the most part her desire for flesh is less carnal and more primal. Raw is a movie where the lead character discovers that she is in fact, a cannibal. Marvelously acted and impeccably written, Raw's depiction of the horrors and beauty of college life in spot-on. There's even a little bit of family dysfunction, sibling rivalry, and the struggle of being female. The movie is simply real in it's portraying of everyday life. You know, minus the cannibal angle. The darker side of the movie is grotesque, twisted, and maybe even a little disturbing. It brings the blood and gore, but doesn't go for shock value. It's remarkably mature where other movies have been excessive or even outright silly. Everything comes together masterfully. It may have a few moments of confusing and pretension that are so often present in the more artsy horror movies of it's ilk, but there's an approachability here that's not always seen in these kinds of films."", ""Raw is another example of just how great 2017 has been for the horror genre. It's smart, vulgar, and, well, RAW! An incredibly gripping and effective ride through the college experience and the insecurities that are forced on women by society. There's a little bit of everything here, and all of it is powerful. Raw is nothing less than a new classic in the horror genre. One that should be a must watch for hardcore enthusiasts. It may not appeal to more mainstream tastes, but there's little denying that it's an incredible film for the more discerning among us."" ]";0.09096433869161144;
baywatch;5;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""Essentially it tries to do for Baywatch what Phil Lord and Chris Miller did for 21 Jump Street. It's stupid, nonsensical, and unnecessarily vulgar. All things I'm usually okay with provided the movie is funny. Baywatch just isn't really. The movie at it's best when it's reveling in it's own absurdity. Something it isn't able to do all that much of as it never gets as goofy or over-the-top as it needs to. The majority of jokes here are of the same variety you'll find in any other modern R-rated comedy these days. The difference is here they feel flatly delivered despite Efron and Johnson giving it their all. There are a few chuckles, but not enough to make this stand out from the pack."", ""The plot is a whole bunch of nothing. It makes no sense, but to be honest it didn't really need to. It just needed to give it's cast reason to do a bunch of stupid stuff. It serves that purpose and not much else. The sense of self-awareness Baywatch has about itself feels underserved. You can't really be in on your own ridiculousness when you aren't that ridiculous after all. When it isn't cracking lame jokes or moving it's bland plot forward with some really boring investgations, the film is all about glorifying beautiful bodies. There's some eye candy here for both the guys and the gals. It's ultimately not a very sexy movie, but if you're really young to the point where you really shouldn't be watching this in the first place, then there might be some excitement here. The rest of us will just sort of not really care."", ""Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are just as likable as ever. The movie? Not so much. It never gets as silly as it needed to be. The results are pretty bland as a result. There are plenty of better comedies out there that play more to the strengths of the two leads.

x-men-apocalypse;7;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""Apocalypse gives us the first X-Men movie to feature a classic lineup of the characters coming together in their teenage years to fight evil under the guidance on Prof. Xavier while not being overshadowed by Wolverine. Essentially it's a close as we've gotten to the X-Men film we've all wanted for years now. However given how many steps forward the superhero movie genre has taken over the years, and Brian Singer's reliance on standard tropes, Apocalypse ends up being an odd mixture of better late than never, and too little, too late."", ""There's a lot to like about Apocalypse. We get the return of the great cast from First Class and DoFP like Fassbender and McAvoy, Sophie Turner's Jean Grey, Evan Peters continually enjoyable Quicksilver complete with more of those amazing super-speed action sequences, and it doesn't crap all over Cyclops. It's got some of the best portrayals of these X-Men characters we've seen onscreen so far. The interpretations still aren't perfect mind you. DoFP couldn't fix everything, so things like age and timeline discrepancies keep things from being just as every comic book fan wants to see it. Nothing short of a reboot of the series will fix that. However, this is still the best we've gotten so far in that department."", ""Given that Apocalypse seemingly does so much right by making good on the promise DoFP set the series up for, what keeps it from achieving greatness? That answer is simply that it's too familiar. With the MCU dominating theatres, the DCEU getting up and running, and the X-Men's own lengthy presence on the silver screen we've seen a lot of villains want to destroy the world. And quite frankly, they were more interesting than Apocalypse."", ""The movie just has a very bland villain. Plus we already know how the fight turns out, so Apocalypse just ends up coming off as some dude who isn't really a threat whose sole purpose is just to break stuff. Then there's how underdeveloped he is."", ""The action itself falls short as well. This is a bunch of special effects driven destruction. The likes of which we've seen in a lot of superhero films lately. Not even the constant display and barrage of these character's powers carries the same level of excitement as before. The action still isn't boring to watch, but it's certainly going through the established motions. Then there's the fact that a lot of these special effects look cheap and dated, particularly in the first half of the movie."", ""What hurts Apocalypse the most is simply superhero fatigue. Brain Singer and FOX do their best to give us the X-Men movie we should've received in the first place all those years ago. For the most part they succeed. The issue it's a little late to do that. The superhero genre has taken off and reached heights one could hardly believe. Going back to basics wounds them here. They got off to their post-DoFP timeline with a shaky start."", ""Does any of this mean Apocalypse is an outright bad movie? No, it's just behind the times. A flaw that's easier to forgive when you consider this is a close as we've come to that perfect X-Men lineup. There's a sort of classic X-Men feel to it and it's just nice to see a lot of the original characters like Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Storm get some real screen-time and actually take part in the action without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine hogging the spotlight. So yeah, it's the most admirable attempt at giving us the perfect X-Men movie that's sadly flawed in key areas. For some this simply isn't going to be enough. For others like myself this will still be a respectable and enjoyable movie. One that still manages to entertain for (finally!) exploring other, original X-Men.

beauty-and-the-beast-2017;7;TheQuietGamer;"[ ""The French fairy tale has once again been brought to the big-screen by Disney. Only this time in live-action form. If one was hoping for a more faithful adaptation of the original story this time around, then they would be disappointed. This pretty much just a remake of the 1991 animated classic. It never strays from what that movie did by much at all, outside of it's own little personal touches to make it not quite a 100% repeat. As a result we are left with a movie that is very familiar as was to be expected based on those trailers. It's very \""been there, done that\"" and doesn't hold a candle to it's animated counterpart. Yet by no means is it a bad movie. There's a reason this tale is as old as time and that's because it's a darn good one."", ""What keeps it from living up to it's predecessor is that it's more cartoonish in nature. There's an extra added sense of goofiness and more humor to every scene. It's missing that dark, more mature tone that made the original so charming, intimate, and effective. It's wonderful to see the dazzling light and pretty sights the director has in store for you. I also laughed regularly. It's clear that this version is more concerned about pure entertainment than having the tale pull at your heartstrings the way it did back in 1991. They even turned down the more menacing aspects of the Beast's personality like his violent outbursts to make it more appealing to all ages. There was a frightening aspect to the character for me as a kid so I see why they did it, but there's no hiding the fact that it hurts the story and romance in the end. Even in my early years when Beast's angry, loud eruptions gave me a fright I didn't mind them. Even then I noticed how it made Belle's slow peeling back of his layers all the more meaningful and effective. I also wasn't too happy with how characters like Cogsworth were pushed more into the background this time around."", ""There's a lot the movie does get right though. For starters it's absolutely gorgeous and the little touches like how the prince's beastly appearance shares features with his true human form. It also extremely well cast. Emma Watson really is the perfect Belle. For the most part the cast has been given more over-the-top versions of the characters. Watson is the only one who plays their character with the exact same conviction as their animated counterpart. Something I do not believe is the rest of the cast's fault. Instead the blame falls on the writer(s) and director. Luke Evans nails Gaston's arrogance and manipulative qualities. Then there's Josh Gad who is an absolute scene-stealer with this new version Le Fou, Gaston's sidekick who turns out to be quite endearing this time around. Much like the animated movie there are musical numbers. Most of which are ripped right from the original. They are surprisingly excellent. The dance accompanying them could have used so much, but it was nice to see, or rather, hear Disney not butcher these wonderful songs."", ""It's magic, romance, fantasy, visual splendor, and well-meaning silliness all rolled up into one big movie. We've basically seen this before and it was no doubt better then, but there is still reason to give this not so new version of a tale as old as time a watch. The qualities that made the fairy tale so well-loved in the first part are still here, albeit in lesser form.

How we pay more attention to the hottest gossip as apposed to what really matter. The social commentary part of the script is actually quite intelligent. However, there is one downside, the dialogue is kinda “meh.\"" It’s either unnatural or kind of forced."", """", ""Sofia Coppola’s direction is pretty good. She gets some interesting shots and really cool slow pans that let us absorb the ambiance. However, at times there is a home movie feel. The soundtrack is filled with energy and enhances the movie to a good enjoyable time. There’s a lot of modern music and it adds a nice effect to the tone that the film is trying to set."", """", ""The characters are interesting and have depth behind them, but the film never delves into the psyche of the characters. Acting on the other hand is really hit or miss. Emma Watson as Nikki, an up and coming bimbo actress, is probably the best acted. Her character really shows how even with a great upbringing, stupidity and surrounding yourself with not so great people can bring you down. Israel Broussard is also pretty good in this film as he becomes the relatable character. He is just as bad as everyone else, but he realizes what he’s doing is bad. Katie Chang is not that great. She usually talks really soft and some of her line delivery is unconvincing. The other actors are okay as some of the lines are cringe worthy, but as the movie progresses they do get better though."", """", ""Overall, “The Bling Ring\"" is a solid movie that is entertaining. The high energy really keeps your interest and their is some intelligence to the script. The dialogue is pretty lame and some of the acting can be cringe-worthy.

42;9;AwesomeReviewer;"[ ""\""42\"" like Spielberg's \""Lincoln,\"" is more about a specific moment in a person's life than his entire life. In this case, this movie is about how Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in professional baseball. The story is about persistence and keeping a cool head through all the torment and backlash of fighting for what you believe in. At the end of the day, it is a movie about overcoming adversity. A type of movie that I tend to favor and for some reason really attracted to and this film is no exception. It is fairly inspiring and a story worth telling."", """", ""The writing in the film is strong and inspiring, but fairly on the surface. The script rarely goes deeper into the issue of racism, but the parts that do transcends the movie to another level.

Director Brian Helgeland, who also wrote the script, put a lot of attention to capturing the era and highlighting the importance of what Jackie Robinson did. Baseball games are well shot and really gives a feel of being their and watching the game live. Even though we know how things play out, we are always guessing and hoping for things to come. The film is well shot and it also has a really nice look that really captures the era in which the movie is set."", """", ""Actors do a great job of playing their respective historical character.

Chadwick Boseman gives a great and reserved performance. We see his anger build in his eyes, but he never shows it on his face or body. It takes incredible skill to give such a compelling performance."", """", ""Overall, \""42\"" is a really good movie and the best film I've seen all year.

side-effects-2013;9;AwesomeReviewer;"[ ""“Side Effects” is a movie, well, about side effects to prescription drugs. However, that’s just on the surface. When you delve deeper into this psychological thriller, it becomes more about the side effects to different choices we make, whether it be positive or negative. The effects it has on us and the ones around us. It is a fairly thought provoking film that let’s us take a look into corruption."", """", ""Steven Soderbergh is a great director, but his biggest complaint maybe that he takes a while to get his movies going. He takes his time to set stuff up, but rewards you at the end with a psychological mind *beep. The attention to detail is commendable, but at times certain things feel a bit contrived. However, when everything starts coming together, it all starts making sense and you can’t help but wonder why you didn’t see it before. The writing is top notch, but the dialogue is all to memorable. The shots are inventive, but feel classic Soderbergh, who always has unusual artsy camera angles. At the end of the day, it is a thought provoking and engaging story. Acting from the entire cast is fantastic. Rooney Mara gives a stunning performance. She has little quirks that make her character enthralling to watch. However, the biggest scene stealer for me is Judd Law, who gives a remarkable performance. He delivers his lines eloquently and with a British flair where you’re captivated by what he says. The whole cast is great and together they make the unmemorable dialogue sensational with their delivery. Overall, “Side Effects” is a engrossing movie that keeps you guessing till the very end. With Soderbergh’s fantastic direction and performances by a dedicated cast this film is a winner by all means. While it may feel disjointed and confusing in the beginning, it becomes entrancing when things start coming together leaving the viewers with a satisfying conclusion. This a great send off for Soderbergh and he will be remembered as a great director for years to come.

The lines of dialogue are genuine and usually pretty funny. However, the film has a layer of heart. It makes you feel for the characters as you learn more and more about them. The main story about a girl who meets a wacky guy is sweet, but the most compelling story of the film is about one of the side characters who tries to rekindle a old romance. That story works in so many ways where we see the pain and joy of the characters and it doesn’t feel tacked on."", """", ""Characters are generally pretty great as they are relateable and the actors do a fine job of bringing them to life. Darius, Aubrey Plaza, is awkward at first, but slowly turns into a more lovable character. Her dead pan humor is hilarious and she says most of the best lines. Plus, Aubrey Plaza manages to bring a lot of emotion to the character. Jeff, Jake Johnson, begins as a sex obsessed jerk, but turns into a very sympathizing character. Jake bring the right amount of  and and emotional depth to the character. He even becomes helpful and really helps develop another character in the film. Mark Duplass does a good job as the on edge Kenneth. The rest of the cast is fairly good as well."", """", ""Overall, “Safety Not Guaranteed” is a really enjoyable film that is not only entertaining, but brisks by. The characters are compelling and offer up more than what they initially promise. However, it doesn’t reach a level of greatness, but it still is one heck of a film.

My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing."", """", ""The cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn’t appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It’s interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can’t stand each other, but can’t be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It’s quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks."", """", ""Overall, “Rush” is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It’s a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer.

This movie had all of the Die hard characteristics we all know and love, and in my opinion, was better than the newest installment to the series! Unlike that film, this movie had tight spaces, a lone ranger in a hostage situation, and even went lengths to feature one of the villains pretending to be a good guy, and is offered cigarettes, just like in 1988. Gerard Butler puts on a solid performance, and leaves me wanting more. A bunch of witty one liners are packed into a superb script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. My favorite line: \""Here's a game we can play. It's called \""Go F**k Yourself\"". You go first.\"" A couple of funny moments and much drama and action make this an excellent thriller.

Overall, this is a lean-back kind  movie that does offer some commentary on life that can be easily-lapped-up by the audience.

gifted;6;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""At best, 'Gifted' is overly sentimental, a movie that tugs on the hearts of many movie-goers and features stellar lead performances by Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. Director Marc Webb ('(500) Days of Summer') tells the story of a freelance boat repairer named Frank (Chris Evans) who ends up going into a legal battle with his mother (Lindsay Duncan) for custody rights for his intelligent niece Mary (Mckenna Grace), who happens to excel at solving complicated maths equations. Upon her first day at school, her teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate) is impressed at her skill to quickly solve maths problems, but is also dismayed at her attitude towards other people. Mary isn't as sociable with people in her age group, and likes to spend most of her time with adults, since she is able to talk to them about things she finds interesting. I admired this movie enough to get on board emotionally with the characters, it's very well crafted, and at times, it can be emotional. Mckenna Grace has a bright future for someone as young as her, and she and Evans carry this movie effortlessly. The only problem here is that the story is not unique, there are other movies - arguably better ones - out there that tell these stories, and provide them with original twists. This movie pretty much walks down the path you expect it to, as far as writing goes. 'Gifted' is the kind of movie you watch for the characters and the acting, but the story could have used more of an emotional punch, and maybe a more original execution. Other than that, this is a movie not to be missed."" ]";0.2503917378917379;
arrival;10;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""'Arrival', along with 'Hell or High Water' (2016) is one of the best movies of the year. Director, Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario'), this film brings in some uneasy tension and atmospheric moments that will keep you hooked through its 1 hour and 55 minute run-time. Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a linguist who is selected after twelve strange extraterrestrial spacecrafts have landed in 12 different parts of the world. What they plan on doing seems unclear to everyone, until Louise manages to find a way to make contact with these strange extraterrestrials. She is brought in by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) who informs her that she might be able to help communicate with these strange species. Along her journey, she also meets military astrophysicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who remains to trust her the most when she is searching for answers. The movie creates this uneasy mix of tension and surprises, like most of Villeneuve's work, it is deliberately paced, but this makes room for some well crafted and carefully handled scenes that are pleasing to the eye. Our main character, Louise, seems emotionally distant from time to time, but we discover her backstory more and more as the film goes on. The sound editing is some of the best I've heard since 'Gravity' (2013), where anything that is loud is loud, and whenever the atmosphere is quiet, it is quiet and remains that way. There are no gimmicks or any unrealistic artificial sounds to make it an easy watch. Everything you see and hear is real. The movie should get Oscar consideration for its sound editing, not to mention that this might just be Villeneuve's best directorial work yet. He should receive a \""Best Director\"" nomination for his work here. If you love mysterious sci-fi with added tension, and even some occasional drama, with some of the best piece of filmmaking ever seen... you owe it to yourself to see 'Arrival'."" ]";0.23156249999999995;

in-bruges;5;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""'In Bruges' is a deliberately paced, slow-burning, and at times, uninteresting comedy. Filled with characters that I did not seem to care for, and a plot that made the film feel at least two times longer than it should have. Colin Farrell plays an Irish hitman named Ray, whose order was to originally kill a priest, but he accidentally killed a young boy while during his task.  He, and his mentor, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges to wait for their next task and instructions. Ken seems to love the city and plans to go sightseeing, but Ray feels indifferent, and at times, is very cynical about the whole thing. Their employer, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) is furious and wants Ken to kill Ray, after coming to the conclusion that Ray killing a child is unforgivable. The movie, directed by Martin McDonagh, has its fair share of some well-thought out scenes, and is crafted the best that it can. However, I found myself to be uninterested in any of the characters and/or events that occur throughout this film. It got very little laughs from me. Colin Farrell is excellent as the sometimes nervous character, Ray, and he shares some excellent screen-time with his co-star, Brendan Gleeson, but ultimately, these great performances weren't enough to keep me invested. It's a mechanical and manufactured comedy, filled with some uplift, but the run-time drags and things escalate towards the third act, but it was too late for me, as whatever interest I had in the movie, was already gone. An admirable effort, but it could have been better."" ]";0.2326630434782609;
troy;6;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""The legendary Achilles goes to battle with the Trojans in Wolfgang Petersen's interpretation of 'Troy', loosely based on the story of \""Ilaid\"". Brad Pitt possesses the role of the legendary Achilles, who is often seen as the greatest warrior. It seems that he has had some quarrels with King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the King often feels concerned over Achilles devil-may-care behavior, and his lack of respect for the king bothers himself. Meanwhile, we see two brothers, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and his younger brother, Paris (Orlando Bloom) negotiating a peace treaty with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). But all that peace fades away when Paris is having a secret affair with Menelaus' wife, Helen (Diane Kruger). When Paris informs Hector about this, Hector feels angry and worried that a war is about to come... and that Menelaus will stop at nothing to make Paris suffer to get his wife back. Upon discovering his missing wife, Menelaus turns to his brother, Agamemnon for help. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity to go to war, and must put all his trust in the talented Achilles to make sure that the war can be easily won. Back at Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) feels concerned when Paris introduces him to Helen, worried that if he is to send her back, Paris would follow her and get killed. He reluctantly decides to let her stay and let events unfold however they can. While the production design of this movie is fascinating, the actors seem to fit the roles that they are cast in - Brad Pitt has the physique for Achilles, Orlando Bloom works as the heart-strung Paris, and Diane Kruger's beauty works for the beauty of Helen - and not forgetting the crafting of the action, it seems that the movie fails to deliver in terms of drama. There is no emotional uphold, no sign of intensity, and no urgency either. It all feels like a typical Hollywood take on one of the greatest legend stories of all time. It's lavish, it's beautiful and it's grand, but underneath all of that lies something somewhat bland. It's not a bad movie, just not a great one. Maybe if the actors were given a chance to act instead of appearing as attractive as possible, it would have worked, and maybe if the dialogue contained more plausibility, it would seem less unintentionally hilarious. Overall, 'Troy' is entertaining, but not gripping."" ]";0.22304029304029305;

When she locks herself in her closet, and makes her wish... she finds herself waking up the next morning as a 30 year old, living with, what we may assume, is her boyfriend, but she has no recollection of anything that may have happened in between the 17 years, and she tries to find answers. She discovers that she is working at a job that she loves, and that she is successful at it, but her former best friend (played by Mark Ruffalo), still resents her after the way she turned him down when they were teenagers. But, she needs him more than ever. This movie is funny and has a lot of charm in it. Garner and Ruffalo share terrific chemistry together as two former friends, who could be something more. The movie, however, is just not as touching as it could have been, I feel that there could have been more emotional weight put into some scenes and maybe one or two more struggles along the journey, but overall, Jennifer Garner is lovely here, leading the movie so effortlessly, and the premise, while far from original, does live up to some expectations."" ]";0.25537269244165794;

Richard Attenborough directs 'Chaplin', and stars a charismatic Robert Downey Jr. as Charles Spencer Chaplin, who grew up with his brother Sydney (Paul Rhys) and his mother (Geraldine Chaplin) in a poverty-stricken household. Charles then enters the entertainment business at a very young age, and this proves to be working out since he has a bright future ahead of him in that field. We see his mother doesn't hold very well, as she develops certain mental issues that lead her to stay isolated for her own good. And it seems that Charles doesn't take this as well as he should. Charles then enters the film industry, but decides to make his own films as he has a certain taste for comedy, that may not be for everyone, but his success overshadows his personal life. We see that Chaplin has been in many relationships with many different women, but they all don't have the time or patience for Chaplin's extensive working time. Time and time again, he works from one movie to another, and it seems that he is becoming over-worked, and even ruling himself against the innovation of cinema when \""talkies\"" are being produced. As I mentioned above, this is a well made biopic that focuses mostly on the downfalls of Chaplin's life, but it doesn't explore the deep and dark emotions as well as I had hoped it would. Downey is electrifying as Chaplin, and deserves his Oscar nomination for the role, but the movie is hollow and too dreary for us to care.

Things get worse when his parents, Kate (Catherine O'Hara) and Peter (John Heard) take off to Paris, and on the flight, realize that they accidentally left Kevin at home, so close to Christmas.

Their main target; the McCallister household. Kevin later realizes this and decides to take matters into his own hands. 'Home Alone', which is directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes ('Planes, Trains, and Automobiles') is very funny, and very charming at the same time.

waiting-for-lightning;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""The critics who diminished this film because they didn't hear enough from Danny are selling the film short. I've seen just about all the recent films in this genre (Dogtown and Z-Boys, Riding Giants, Step into Liquid, etc.), and I think this one is highly inspirational in its own right. You hear enough from Danny to understand his motivations. And we hear so much from celebrities and athletes today (interviews, social media), it's almost refreshing to see a guy who lets his performances and his grace speak for him. The tragic losses of Danny's male role models definitely help mold who he is, for better or for worse, but he's an incredible role model for what hard work and persistence can do for you. For a guy who is afraid of heights to do what he does is really unthinkable. Good for DC for making the film happen, and I realize it's the nature of the beast, but the entire film had a Quicksilver/DC Shoes imprint on it which is a bit unusual for a feature film - and it detracted from my enjoyment, but only slightly. It was great seeing Rob Dyrdek and Ken Block supporting Danny on the Great Wall jump.

John Goodman gives it his all, but there's only so much he can do with a script that is so content to steal from the original. Baloo the bear has been made into a bland parody of himself, Bagheera does nothing but nag constantly and Mowgli has lost any character that he had. Overall, this is pretty much any inferior copy of the original. If you want a good version of Rudyard Kipling's book, either watch the first movie or the recent remake.

Her name was Kira. She was a gelfing. She was the most beautiful...muppet, I had ever seen(way, way, way prettier than Miss Piggy). Even though \""Arthur & the Invisibles\"" largely covers the same terrain as \""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\"", a scene like the one in which Arthur shares a rosebud-turned-bed with Princess Selenia, somewhat alleviates this formulaic film from the commercially-mandated instinct that it's noisy action in which audiences yearn for. The age difference between Arthur and Princess Selenia is provocative(they come close to kissing), but never sordid; always sweet. If \""Arthur & the Invisibles\"" had more ambition and artistry, the filmmaker could've chopped the running time of this first adventure(a tired story about recovering rubies to help save the farm), and reunited the age-challenged couple when Arthur got older. Princess Selenia isn't like the dragon in the Peter, Paul & Mary folksong(she's corporeal), but Arthur's affinity for this Minimoy may not last once he starts meeting human girls; which is what's intriguing, and potentially fatalistic, about Princess Selenia's promise that she'll wait for him."" ]";0.18505291005291008;

Then in 1998, there's this. In terms of style, Antz is a huge departure from Toy Story. There is an astounding amount of profanity for a CGI film, there's a lot of violence, and it is implied that one of the soilder ants r**** another ant (so says imdb). Toy Story is a fun film for the whole family. This is not."", ""This idea is not original. A former Disney employee, during production of A Bug's Life, left and took the story with him. His name was Jeff Katzenburg. I think that's the guy who almost led Toy Story into ruins. See the Black Friday Reel of Toy Story. Then you'll know what I'm talking about . So the guy who I THINK almost made Toy Story a horrible film went to Dreamworks and created \""Antz\"" a more violent, less family-friendly \""A Bug's Life\"" with termites instead of grasshoppers. And I really think kids should not be hearing the swear words said in the movie , especially the b word. Well, at least the producers knew better then to put the f-bomb. There are good things about this movie. It made CGI water possible. And Woody Allen's in it. That's a good thing. And the ants look more realistic than they do in \""A Bug's Life\"".

The human casting was sheer brilliance, especially Robert De NIro as Fearless Leader. After seeing him in so many mob-related films, it was a refreshing change to see him basically making fun of himself. Piper Perabo was awesome in here.
