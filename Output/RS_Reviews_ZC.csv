Post-WWII, a USA naval veteran inadvertently hops on a yacht one night and is hooked on a cult named “The Cause”, lead by its eloquent yet irascible master, while being an avid follower of the master, his perennial booze-abusive, sex-driven, violent nature enables himself to be the soul needs salvation, a side-kick and a role model, it also encroaches his mental realm and life orientation, eventually challenges his loyalty with The Cause and the master. PTA’s trademark roving and tracking long-shots maintain as engaging as any directors could ever achieve, not obtrusive but impeccably tally with the storytelling; the retro-soaked palette authentically establishes a mystic aura of the inexplicable internal mechanism of how our emotion rises and falls, attended by a rhythmic score from Jonny Greenwood."", """", ""Joaquin Phoenix gives me a first impression of Michael Shannon (whose TAKE SHELTER 2011, 9/10 is among my top pick of 2011), in a far gaunter figure, he embodies his character so devotedly and destructively, it is a privilege to appreciate his hunchback stance, the unique way when he speaks (English words evade me now, help?), his exuberance, his furore, his confusion and his determination. The erosive bitterness conceals in his gawky body is compelling and he is a war victim, a damaged good seeking for a rejuvenation, the master and The Cause may or may not cure him, anyhow, he still possess his free will, if only the power of repetition works. Philip Seymour Hoffman, doesn’t need too much physique alternation though, is equally mesmerizing if not too overbearing, his mind-blowing delineation of the master’s polarized volatility is another textbook archetype of performance art. Amy Adams, whose fourth Oscar-nomination in 8 years has wrought some dissent here, accomplishes an amazing expressionless supporting performance, her role doesn’t require any ostentatious flare-up, but each time her composure and relentlessness exudes disparate feelings from inside (blithe, haughty, disdained, confident, commanding, suspicious, disgusted, etc.), and her “milking the cow”coalition with Hoffman is simply petrifying.    Grabbing only 3 acting nominations (with faint possibility to win any of them), THE MASTER’s bumpy Oscar-road is far from triumphant compared with THERE WILL BE BLOOD, but time will testify whether it is an overlooked masterpiece or an elusive piece of self-indulgent, but no matter on which case, one cannot deny that it heralds that PTA is most probably on his way to be the Stanley Kubrick of our generation (not least suggested by the evocative nudity scenes which seemingly pay tribute to the masked orgy in EYES WIDE SHUT 1999, 8/10), and it is a tremendous blessing for all the cinephiles."" ]";1

Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced.

Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances.  Being an agnostic, Pi’s eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn’t register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be “a story could make one believe in God”, the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as “religions”is concerned. The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly-recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee’s versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible."" ]";2

I would have given the oscar to him that year. Incredible what he did with his character. I give the movie a 10 because there´s no flaw one can find. Crash winning over Brokeback and Munich was the biggest joke in the Academy´s history. At least it got 3 including best director."" ]";1

non-stop-2014;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Non-Stop is a 2014 mystery suspense action thriller set aboard a flight from New York to London, starring none other than Liam Neeson. It’s fortunately not in the style of Taken, whereby almost everything is offset by enjoyable, brainless action and a completely illogical plot, but this being from this specific genre with Liam Neeson it’s often hard to let off so easily. Sure, we gain a sympathetic situation from an air marshal with horrific problems to deal with (I couldn’t help it when it was announced his daughter had died from acute leukaemia at the age of 8, mirrored with the conversation with Jennifer about the blue ribbon that his 17 year old daughter had given him because despite being who he is, he’s still pretty much a damaged person), the film itself doesn’t often follow through with the morality themes it has given itself. To an extent, it is entertaining in a better way that you have to use your brain (for the most part), but has an ancient habit of not in the least well done plot devices."", """", ""Liam Neeson is Bill Marks, an air marshal, who discovers the flight he is on has someone threatening to kill a passenger on board every 20 minutes if $150 million is not wired to a given account number. The set-up is simple and solid and we come to an understanding of a thrilling suspense ride that combines both intelligence and action. The hype is definitely not surprising."", """", ""We gain much of this from the acknowledgement of the question many people would be asking: “How do you kill someone on a passenger plane without anyone noticing?” I mean, with the limited space 40,000 ft. above the ground, it would be too easy. That film wouldn’t exactly be the most popular."", """", ""It helps that we are given a conventional beginning to lead us through, with the usual action of boarding the plane (his alcoholism is prominent right from the start) and interacting with crew members and passengers. In particular he takes a shine to Jennifer Summers (played by Julianne Moore) and manages to find trust in Steward Nancy Hoffman (played by Michelle Dockery)."", """", ""This is significant to the plot strength, because if he is to discover how someone kills someone aboard a passenger plane discreetly, he needs to know about the other passengers and that includes asking for help. Although, there’s a weakness here – of course it’s meant to be difficult considering the circumstances and what better way than to throw a plot twist in there? However, it does stretch out coherently enough, really only until the final act where a plot device manages to make its way in."", """", ""What doesn’t make sense is that Bill gains and regains people’s trust too quickly in spite of the revelations. Perhaps the sympathy card was played for that reason – they can’t trust him enough as an air marshal but after airing his problems people have no other idea but to. I suppose it wouldn’t work if he didn’t have the jaded persona, but at the same time it doesn’t come naturally. If they had only one reason to trust him it would be because what he was doing was trying to save their lives and that they had to. The media is a volatile outlet and to retract the statement of being the FBI’s (we’re talking high class investigation here) prime suspect in a hijacking wouldn’t be that easy to do."", """", ""The film sometimes forgets that it aims to bring its own morality to the table due to its own idea of logic."", ""The distrust is too often forgotten, the theme of futility and hope getting more intermittent as the film progresses and whether the physics of being able to muffle a bomb blast in an airplane while managing to land it and have the present passengers all survive still sounds questionable. But a specific saving grace happens to be a young girl named Becca, travelling alone to meet her father, a walking symbol of a fragment of Bill’s life that he can finally share an experience with that he was never able to last with his own daughter. The blue ribbon being quite obvious."", """", ""To an extent, this film is an enjoyable ride that sets up on a take-off with a solid, excusable premise that misses points and jumps too quickly. It is refreshing to see a wide range of people represented, showing a distinctive power of a lack of discrimination. When Bill doesn’t know who to trust, it’s simple to know he’s doing it out of a genuine lack of knowledge and that he addresses those he needs to in order to know what’s really going on. What doesn’t work though, is that what ends up as a possible development ends up being squandered for the usual kind of ending – Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson looking at each other in the style of a happy ending of a romantic comedy. Being a mystery suspense action thriller, that’s definitely not what I was expecting (for a Liam Neeson film, I was hoping he didn’t have to do this)."" ]";1
the-lego-movie;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I would consider it offensive if this was labelled simply as a '100 minute commercial'. It may be made involving a corporate franchise, but it is there to teach, not to sell."", """", ""The LEGO Movie uniquely combines smart sharp satire towards examples like pop culture and consumerism, a charming voice cast voicing a whole array of interesting characters (if you look close enough, some of the characters parody the usual stock characters) and a morality tale. It not only subverts tropes, but also subverts expectations right until the end. It's difficult to see a film just once, especially when it contains so much humour and wit when mocking things left right and centre."", """", ""Everything I feel about this film is exciting. Animation can show itself to stand out in throwing out a non generic message involving politics, business and culture. The villain himself shows the audacity as a president to not only demonstrate his nefariousness, but impose his own ideologies with no room for creativity. Not only that, but the LEGO Movie also plays on the cliches of many outrageous tropes - how does it work out when a simple, ordinary construction worker is suddenly announced as the centre of the prophecy as 'the Special'? What happens when he encounters someone considered to be the 'manic pixie dream girl'? The split personality of the Good Cop Bad Cop is refreshing when it comes to two distinctively defined cops interrogating someone, and the gleeful decision made about Green Lantern after his film ultimately failed is dark but amusing."", """", ""However, when it comes to happy endings, even that doesn't remain the same. Even for the villain himself. It doesn't spit out the usual kind of messages - whether on the scale of the morality tale or the satire surrounding politics and the like."" ]";4

It is dark and menacing - but that's what it's supposed to be. Considering the feature length animation around the 30's or 40's was not supposed to be a blissful fairytale, the recreation of this famous tale is exquisitely well acted and accurately portrayed. Some elements of the film were quite disturbing, but the light-heartedness of the dwarves helped to provide a few laughs and the sweetness of the music and especially the scenery of the Sanctuary added a bit more spirit to the mixture. Also, Kristen Stewart has a very notable role in this film despite her criticism for her role in the Twilight films."" ]";1
war-horse;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Yes, it's a horse. Thousands of soldiers died in the First World War, but it was OK because a horse lived. That does sound cheesy. Steven Spielberg is sometimes known for his cheesiness, but I think the point about the horse was, wherever it went, it touched the hearts of everyone. It showed strength at the worst of times. The sad scenes made my heart ache, but the happier, more pleasant scenes helped me through, such like the horse.

tinker-tailor-soldier-spy;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Does everything have to be in your face all the time? I get how people assume that a film is bad if it's too complicated, but don't people ever notice the subtleties within films? It's understandable if it's a completely complicated mess of sorts that doesn't fit together properly, but if people miss the connections because they wanted a smooth, straightforward spy thriller, then, I'm sorry, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Sure, because this is to do with multiple aspects within the Cold War, I and perhaps many other people found it difficult to get on the right foot at the beginning, but still, I found it entertaining. Sometimes, I thought there were too many characters. Maybe perhaps I may have missed something and brought this upon myself, probably due to the fact that I had a focus on the talent of certain distinguished actors - my moderate expectations considering this. My favourite part was the awkward yet cute chemistry that played between Oldman's and Cumberbatch's character, which I found particularly fascinating. But I couldn't blame myself if I missed something. I still managed to see some of my favourite actors and gain a certain understanding. Sure, you wouldn't be able to gain a complete understanding of it at first viewing, but that's quite often a good thing, because you know you'll be able to watch it again. There is a difference between complicated and complicated and clever, because to me, connections and references are important in a film like this, instead of a muddled, struggling mess."" ]";2
fright-night;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I should have seen this at the cinema but I got caught up in other things. It sounded extremely fascinating when I first heard about this, mostly considering there were some great actors in it, like David Tennant and Colin Farrell. When I did see this a couple of days ago, I suddenly agreed with my previous statement. To make it more effective, my parents turned out all the lights in the house, so all I could see was this disturbing glow of a bloodthirsty vampire tearing out someone's throat. Colin Farrell makes for a very effective vampire; (he was my favourite character) he didn't really scare me, he was more creepy than that. He certainly had the look and quality of a vampire. Remakes aren't normally as good as the original, but despite the normality, the acting, the dialogue, the atmosphere - it all creeped the hell out of me. This is also fantastically gory and the actors just passed swiftly under it, refusing to give in despite the fact that there was a vampire on the loose. Nothing like Twilight - as Ed described Jerry (cool name for a supernatural creature by the way) - he's the freaking shark from Jaws. In fact, this is very, very good quality. Would have liked it to have a higher score, but at least the reviews were mostly favourable. It just seemed a damn shame that I didn't see it when it came out, especially in 3D. It was extremely thrilling and heart-pounding though anyway. Highly recommended."" ]";3
midnight-in-paris;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""An exquisite artwork of colourful characters, who all possess qualities that more or less contribute to the make-up of the paint and canvas, and the awe-inspiring surroundings of Paris, such as the glittering lights on the water and the shining little alleyways from little side-streets and cobblestone paths. Well, there's so much more, with the usual sights such as the Eiffel Tower and even over the particular bridge overlooking the lilies on the pond which was painted by Monet, but Woody Allen certainly has a thing of capturing the wonderful spirit of the small things. I think his point was to look at the surroundings of Paris at all times of the day, but we certainly got to look at the irrefutable sophistication of historical characters, which in no way conveyed a sense of patronising naivety, who could be said to be fascinating. With multiple angles and dry humour, this film has class with the use of talented actors and actresses and ends on a stylishly sweet note, ironically beginning the dream of a happily settled character (and audience) with not a scent of cliché in the Paris air."" ]";3
surrogates;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""One of the main flaws of this film is that a film based on androids that create an idealistic version of themselves revolves around the inventor, who becomes disillusioned at how they've changed from aiding less able people such as himself to somewhat empty and materialistic concerns. The college student was a fair target, considering who they were aiming for. However, this becomes a side issue among the division between the predictability and the actual exploration of humanity's frightening procrastination at becoming old and unable to go through life. This was in contrast with turning it into some kind of fashion statement, as if artificiality and beauty can prolong meaning of life itself. Bruce Willis is ultimately superb in this role, considerably cynical and not sarcastic, distinctive in a world of people who are plugged into androids. In turn, there are obvious cliches that you would find in an action sci-fi, albeit having action that was just as necessary as the dialogue."" ]";2
zombieland;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""If this was supposed to a zombie comedy, I wasn't sure which I saw most of. There were some awesome jokes, but I felt they became a little too few and far between. I also think the pacing was also a little uneven, because considering it was barely an hour and a half it was a little slow at first and then sped up. I preferred the characters and more or less the ending as that's when it had a little more depth. The rules made up by Columbus were pretty awesome though - and pretty useful when a real zombie apocalypse happens."" ]";1
sherlock-holmes;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Since this is based on an inspiring part of historical literature, people have come at it with their all, and what I'm mostly hearing is that it has turned much into an action movie and that they were 'getting tired of people being beaten up'. What might have been missed is the intellect that was deduced by Holmes, and that people may more have noticed the significant amount of violence because of it being seen on screen, and you have to look closer in order to pick up the lesser significant and more unnoticed details. Sherlock Holmes may have had violence and explosions in it, but it showed Holmes as an experienced person that didn't just go around injuring people for the fun of it. He looked for clues, he came to conclusions, he used logic. Ritchie may have spiced up this new Holmes a little more than people expected, but it added to the fun of the movie. It didn't show him in a new light, it just showed us his capabilities and his strength for his environment. People might not have picked up on this, and the fact it might have been 'too complicated and boring' means that they probably weren't focusing on it as such to figure it out for themselves. You might have expected what was going to happen, seeing as it was based on a piece of famous literature, but Sherlock Holmes of course is opened to interpretation. Then why go in there and see it, not bother to focus on the finer details, at least enjoy the film, and beforehand think you're going to expect something completely different? It's confusing how people thought this film would happen, and how it was going to turn out. With all these production teams and crews designing and creating this imaginative piece of media, why think you're going to get a tame bunch of people solving mysteries without any spice like the book says?"", ""I, myself, loved the performance by Robert Downey Jr., who seemed to fit into the role like a glove. Why bother with any other actor when you've got him around to play a bohemian detective who performs experiments on animals (O.K, a little out of touch there)? Although he's American, that was not a barrier to him when he spoke in a brilliant Victorian English accent.  It's harder than you think trying to cast these people, and what better way than such a famous star? Not to mention the good-looking British actor Jude Law, who, fair to say, did a superb job as Dr. Watson. Not bad picking an actor who lives on the opposite side of the pond, as they say."", ""As I said, I think many people missed out on the joyfulness and intellect of the film, because there was so much in there to look for. The characters themselves were not on a 'clown caper' or some unimportant journey as such, but I think there was more to them than people actually thought. Although films are for entertainment, you can also see the difference between this and what Conan Doyle wrote. It's a free country when it comes to this kind of interpretation, as Ritchie did nothing to harm one of the most famous fictional characters in history. The darkness of it did not put me off at all, it merely added to the climax, and it was extremely useful in aiding the referencing of the character's next worst scheming supervillain, Professor Moriarty. Since when can films like these pull of darkness, action, mystery and suspense, comedy and adventure without screwing up? And here we have it, a solid gold take on the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. You can't get much better interpretation than this - there is no equal in this war - as this, my friends, is king."" ]";4
atonement;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""A sweet film. The lives entwined by childhood innocence, love and consequences enlivened by the beautiful natural surroundings helped it become more bearable. This film was naturally emotional, instead of forcing yourself not to cry, it does it for you. It also has one of the most haunting endings you could ever have in such a drama. If the film is that good, I will have to read the book as well. The acting in this is also particularly significant, such as the traumatic performance of the life of Briony."" ]";3
hairspray;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""It's supposed to be light-hearted, I can guarantee you that, but the bright colours just make everything look so garish. When it comes to making a feel-good musical comedy about racism, you've got to get the ingredients right - this just has a little too much sugar in it. Sometimes that songs can also get a little sickening each time you watch it as well. When it comes to John Travolta, he looks a little weird (and perhaps stupid) playing Tracy's mother. Nonetheless, it had clear boundaries over certain characters, understandably pointing out the antagonists from the good guys (and gals).

the-prestige;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I think it's worth pointing out that this film is rather more intelligent than complicated. It showed this by hooking you in via the first few minutes with the scenario and then explaining in depth about it from different perspectives. That's one of the first films I've ever seen do that and it remained intriguing throughout - and the end! That was probably the best ending I've ever seen! There was no loose ends, but with what the film gave you, it left you awe-inspired and shocked - who was who and what really went on? I was fascinated by the psychological aspects - it helped unearth more of the more disturbing characteristics of humanity - obsession and revenge. When you look at it, the magician's theme reflected these secrecies and psychological tricks that were employed. The actors were amazing - I didn't think Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale would star in a film together, but who cares, they were a perfect pair! It's just like Batman versus Wolverine but with magic. Despite that, the science alongside magic was a bit interfering as I was still more interested in finding out the surprise over surprise that continued to entertain me. Try not to big it up too much, Mr Nolan, you're brilliant at directing, but just try not to make it appear too big before it becomes a confusing, bloated mess."" ]";3
war-of-the-worlds;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I could see that the expectations for this sort of film would be mixed, but, for me, in a sense, I was optimistic about seeing Tom Cruise in a different film rather than Mission:Impossible. Funnily enough, Spielberg managed to pull if off, especially filming an American adaptation. But that didn't bother me, because I was gripped more or less by the time the tripods arrived. There are quite a few unnerving moments which made my skin crawl. It was worth watching, because it felt quite real, especially how the characters were feeling. A thrilling ride - Tom Cruise should do more of this. Great how the Americans could have a shot at this. The special effects were mind-blowing.The beginning felt a little stretched out, but at least the pace was relaxed halfway through the film. Overall, a film definitely worth watching."" ]";2

Despite the panic-stricken individuals running around aimlessly, this film has a tight zombie-romance-comedy edge to it and some of the killings are just hilarious. It doesn't need to be sophisticated, which it isn't, but it doesn't reduce it to slapstick and toilet humour either. This film enters straight through the middle instead. Although it had zombies in it, there was a lot of comedy because most things were played for laughs, but there were a few horrific moments. Makes Shaun's monotonous life much more exciting and probably anyone else's life as well. Take control of your life, like Shaun - even if it includes the zombie apocalypse."" ]";4
the-day-after-tomorrow;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This film is good - I like the characters but most of all I found the climate change plot fascinating. This made the intense scenes with the snow and the rain quite entertaining, but it was pretty emotionally intense  as well. It's not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it when I was younger and I enjoyed it now. It still delivers brilliantly, and Jake Gyllenhaal is still as clever and gorgeous as usual."" ]";2
50-first-dates;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I was particularly put off by the beginning - the jokes were more or less unfunny - so I was almost put off from watching the whole film. The jokes began to get funnier and I felt kind of at ease because it was less about slapstick and more about what was going on. Adam Sandler has that unique humour where you either like it or hate it. I think the film was slightly messy in its construction, certain pieces were skipped to and the conclusion was a bit rushed. It lacked depth because of its limited explanation - although it helped to replay events that had previously happened. That doesn't make it a bad film though, because sometimes romantic comedies are just meant to be enjoyed, and this example of a medical condition in a beautiful romantic environment is refreshingly original."" ]";1
x-men-the-last-stand;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This was almost strong enough to stand on its own two feet. The action doesn't overshadow the plot or the emotional aspect too much and there's a beautiful collection of individuals that moves smoothly along, bringing some amazing variety without forgetting about them. This doesn't necessarily have a particular main character and I enjoyed the twist of Jean Grey along with the epic, all-out war between different sides. I liked how the mutants particularly were working during this, because it was different to how it was when they were just fighting in the previous two films. Of course, Ratner didn't seem to have much grip on how Singer did it because from the way I saw it, the emotional aspects were difficult to control. Despite the variety, there was a lot of running and unnecessary fighting. Overall, although it wasn't as good as the previous two films, I thoroughly very much enjoyed it."" ]";2
anger-management;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I see no reason why a film like this shouldn't receive such brilliant reviews. When I watched it, I thought it was hilarious - I could never imagine Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson as such a pairing. The antics that both of them get up to could knock me off my feet any time. I wouldn't say that this movie was peppered with just jokes about private parts, because it wasn't. This film had a deeper meaning than that, especially as it was one man's unexpected journey to find himself. Although that sounds a bit weird, it's true, but the fact it psychologically meaningful and still manages to pull off the most hilarious jokes, it's one of the best films of its kind."" ]";4
twelve-monkeys;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""A very touching and thought-provoking film surprisingly made by Terry Gilliam, one of the people behind Monty Python. The insight and themes surrounding this brilliant science-fiction film have depicted that somehow we ourselves are unsure of what is real and what is not. Each actor has their own creative part to play, and despite what you may think, with all the life-threatening and time-travel twists to get your head around, it will end up having a real impact on you, thinking about the real issues that are actually quite close to home."" ]";3
halloween-1978;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This is an honestly suspenseful thriller  it truly builds up right from the beginning. The fantastic simplicity of using the same soundtrack throughout lacks monotone and adds creepy familiarity, the neighborhood as the setting proves to be a falsely secure yet sunny environment. You're almost begging Michael Myers not to take off the mask which illustrates someone who looks human, but feels inhuman with those dark, merciless look in where his eyes should be. The colour is a muted, almost grainy tone, giving a more authentic 80's feel, with the shadow in the background disappearing with a second look which we unquestionably accept until the real thrills happen, as the haunting presence that contrasted with the setting is able to come out. Even when he does, Myers is still both intimidating and ruthless as he picks them off."", ""The self-reference of a director undoubtedly feels out of place, but the psychiatric character of Dr. Loomis played brilliantly with undeniably precise questioning by Donald Pleasance. We can forgive his more likely ridiculous stance as he searches for his patient, because it is counter-acted by such an emotionless, inhuman embodiment of nature vs. nurture with no solid reason to kill."", ""The running time was in tune with the story-line without frequent jump scares to provide nutrition, the kills worthwhile when they happen with a amazingly juicy one in the downstairs kitchen. It works with realism  a quiet, normal neighborhood disrupted by, rather than a raging presence, a silent stalker that symbolically represents the real safety of our neighborhood which can be likewise seen in other twisted slashers such as A Nightmare On Elm Street. The killer that comes out from beneath its shell and strikes without warning. A 6 year old with no soul, a butcher knife and murder on his mind? That is an argument that writes itself."" ]";4
equilibrium;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""An underrated piece of art, this bleak future where emotions are forbidden has an ironic emotional core to it. It doesn't surround itself with blatant copies of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, in fact, what many people would assume are carbon copies I would prefer to call references, harking back to other dystopian films while also being a standalone film in its own right. Equilibrium treats the matter with mild stoicism, foreshadowing particular events in a neat way that manages to explode in a thrilling yet thoughtful way. The ignorance of many critics that assumed the worst, didn't seem to see the whole picture. None of this was about the fact that censorship exists or that you could be executed for certain crimes. The whole idea of the film was to make you see how people behaved through lack of emotion, with the failure to see that emotion is what makes us human. Rather than take a purely political motive, it manages to incorporate perhaps a majorly ethical motive. The action that is contained in this film is not just for showing off. The stylistic features render the action scenes mindblowing, but no less helping to drive the core theme of the story - besides, the main character is a cleric, trained in the art of Gun Kata (a thrilling name for a sadly non-existent masterpiece of fighting style) who manages to put a chink in Libria's armour as we see through his perspective by realising he can use this weapon against the system that attempts and fails to betray him as someone who is 'feeling'. When I first regarded this film, I became fascinated about how, amongst the close-ups and wider shots, the main character seems to obviously show some kind of emotion without the intrusion of the system demanding why on earth he hasn't been arrested for his crimes. This ultimately came to the climax, whereby the foreshadowing managed to sneak its way in at the beginning. The fact that Christian Bale was chosen for this role makes me wonder why some people didn't think this was good, considering how deft he was in executing the action, the visual non-speaking scenes and the dialogue. To the amazing use of irony, a number of heart-rending scenes kept up the core theme, and the stylistic use of camera focus on Christian Bale emphasised the distress that we could feel he was going through, one being his flinching when we don't see the dogs being shot, but we can feel it by way of his reaction. However, I thought one of the most chilling scenes was during a raid of someone's apartment, with fires burning and people spattered with blood, was the simplicity of a dying man running into the main character, known as John Preston, bleeding, desperation and hope glittering in his eyes as he slides down, leaving Preston aghast and completely horrified, reflecting the man's pain. The expression on his face could not have been possibly matched, Christian Bale just executed that so perfectly that I could feel myself choking up and stopping dead. So this film, by none the way anything completely copied from other films, is a masterpiece in its own right. By way of insulting the stylistic features to convey emotion and provide thrilling action that shaped the film, the amazingly well-acted characters that were to no end incredibly fascinating, the amazingly clever storyline, you are refusing to take it to the light of some of the world's greatest films and distastefully making the biggest mistake of throwing it away. Like the scene in the film, whereby Preston awakes from a nightmare with shock and overwhelming emotion, tears away the fabric from the window to reveal glimmering light on the horizon and a rainbow glowing in the rain, it strips away the layers as the film goes on, lulling you into a false sense of security, but instead just brings you surprises exploding onto the scene, leaving you brimming with hope at the end. Look out for the poignant reference of Yeats."" ]";4
who-framed-roger-rabbit;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I see no reason not to like this film, it's uproariously funny, with plenty of memorable scenes and quotes to keep you going for ages. Each and every character are suited to their roles, perfectly picked, as a film, you have to have a particular set of actors and actresses to play certain people, or voice cartoon people and animals, otherwise your film will dramatically flop at the box office. You can see here that the production crew did not fail to call on the best of the people in order to create the classic movie of all sorts."", ""Unlike many more modern films where a hybrid of live-action and animation is created, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the best types of these films where the interactions between the live people and the cartoons and accuracy of positioning cartoons in the right place are realistic, and you can actually see relationships developing between real life people and cartoons. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is certainly fine art, in particularly the finest, as well as being funny, there is always a darkness beneath, in the form of Judge Doom, which is played with amazing precision by Christopher Lloyd. It does so without ruining the atmosphere, as some films always fail to combine darkness and laughter in the certain amount of time."", ""This film is for everyone - who says its for kids only? Of course there are innuendos and threats which goes over kids heads, but it has a certain something which makes it for everyone. I was 16 when I first watched it, and I loved it."" ]";4
spider-man;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I found Maguire portrayed Spider-Man in an accurate way - I don't think Parker is supposed to be cool and Maguire had that specific look about him. The story itself was entertaining, although it was slightly imbalanced in the way that we saw too much of Spider-Man rather than the villain, but that's not a particular problem, in way of the style of development of the story. Many of my concerns were with Mary Jane, who I felt kind of interfered in some scenes where she tried too hard to look independent but it was obviously see through as she behaved much more desperate and helpless. The villain was O.K, but I think his costume looked a bit childish and plasticky. This film is entertaining but it is flawed. Maguire is an extremely good Spider-Man - much better suited to the role than Garfield - but it was mostly the other characters who needed more space and time to improve in light of the flaws that I have pointed out."" ]";1
one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I can't tell whether this movie is either heart-warming of the powerful struggle against a dictatorial ruler, or a sad tale within the harshness of the mental hospital representation of the control built within autocratic societies. It's not like they treat you as human beings, pickled on drugs and manipulated through humiliation."", ""But, the role of this anti-authoritarian rebel, who goes along the name of Randle P. McMurphy and the main protagonist of this inspirational film, is perfectly suited to a gentleman called, and of which became his debut award-winning role, Jack Nicholson. A choice of a lifetime - either that, it would take him years to get noticed, probably. Do you think he would have gained roles in such films as As Good As It Gets, playing an obsessive compulsive with an attitude problem? Something's Gotta Give? Anger Management? He certainly looked like he deserved that Academy Award for best actor, which is quite a stupid statement, because he did."", ""And who wouldn't give to play a role, a role against an autocratic system. Somehow a sad, somehow ferocious battle. The main antagonist, Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, as well as having a name that sounds like a sharp, steel knife, a cold, biting winter, making you think of scratchy, horrible things, it was her calm, yet within, sadistic, demeanour that somehow took a strong grip, on not just the ward full of patients with multi-layered problems, but the audience. The involvement creates a chilling and uncomfortable atmosphere, yet you carry on watching the film because you want to see what happens within this system, being just so engrossed in it to not stop watching it. It's films like these that keep us on our toes and feel for ourselves the control and power that these patients experienced."", ""I cannot predict people's reactions for the ending, although it might be obvious to some. There is always a difference between the book and the film. Chief Bromden, apart from Randle, (or 'Mack', how he is called), is sane, not exactly showing it in the beginning. Seems like a one way ticket to peace and tranquillity, but it is fortunate enough that Randle was lucky to be there with him in the first place. Instead of thinking that the villains have to have their way, it is often an accomplishment within the human spirit, and Randle certainly brought the spirit within the hospital. Winning 5 Academy Awards which including Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) and Best Screenplay, this psychological drama is none more deserving which makes you think more about the society we live in. And for me? A touching poignant idea on the idea of an autocratic society, and the strength of the human spirit."" ]";4
mars-attacks!;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This stylistic feature of black comedy has put quite a mark on reflecting and perhaps parodying America's attitudes towards culture and materialism. The fact that the design of the UFOs and Martians were less shoddy and more of what we think of them means that it helps to look at these in terms of our assumptions. A great ensemble of character with their own time to shine, the comedy is affectionate as well as outrageous. It's not meant to be predictable, it's the fact that the characters should have seen this one coming."" ]";2
groundhog-day;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This film is lovable, it symbolises hope and enlightenment, it is uplifting, it is funny, it has an AMAZING cast (Bill Murray plays it so well), but most of all, being a comedy, it manages to pull this all off without reverting to slapstick, tired and forced punchlines and predictability. Romance doesn't bother this cool old classic, it's all part of the beauty and the sparkling light at the end of this tunnel."" ]";3
the-bucket-list;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I find it kind of heartless how such a movie is dismissed as a piece of sentimental frivolity. Since when? I find it difficult to understand that this sort of movie is sentimental - it may be in parts, but that's not the point. This was about morality, about humanity, the human condition. To show you that you shouldn't blow all your life away, because of life's unpredictability. This had a meaning, a PROPER meaning, unlike other movies. I would highly recommend this movie, because when you cry during this movie, you will feel better for it. Sometimes it's good to cry, and where a movie can make you laugh and cry around the same time, there's no way you'd want to miss this. If you want a REAL sentimental pile of garbage, go check out Titanic, which in my opinion, is TOTALLY overrated."" ]";4

Good choice of actors - it was good to see actors other than American ones at the top of the list. I think these films will grow on me, I can't wait for the next ones. Partly fascinating, partly disturbing, partly funny, partly almost everything. Not to mention, Hugh Jackman is incredibly sexy as Wolverine. Damn."" ]";3
rain-man;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I would assume that because of the film's topic that this could be a tough one to handle. Autism is a touching topic, but it gives us an idea of both character's vulnerability and unstable personality. This is not supposed to be a weepy film, it is a film of beauty and wonder, of the dark and light sides of the human condition. It just dips enough to get us to think what might be right for people with disabilities and leaves us to make our own assumptions on this sort of issue. Of course, both main characters aren't numb, sometimes they just hide their feelings away, but we can obviously see how both of their lives entwine, without turning into a tear-jerking drama. It just makes us able to view the world we live in in a different light. When it comes to these sorts of films, often you're left wondering about the uptight views of the critics and the public, ESPECIALLY THE CRITICS."" ]";3
the-happening;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""It may be no finer a horror film than other similar distinguished works, but it worked for me. The acting may have been a little off-par, but Shyamalan has produced something that is worth watching. The actors were well matched and the way events were anticipated through the wind in the trees and grass disturbed me thoroughly. Not only that, but the acts themselves alongside the atmospheric music almost scared the living daylights out of me. I think this film effectively posed a message towards the sceptics out there, of a growing problem that we need to face before it's too late, even if nobody else thought so."" ]";1
twins;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Despite a weak beginning, this film manages to instead keep going up instead of sinking even lower. The actors are perfect for their roles - their contrast provided the strength it needed to maintain the thickening plot. Very good comedy - I think it weighed it down a little, which is often a side effect of trying to implement comedy so forcefully just because it was a comedy. But the upside was that it was funny anyway without trying too hard. What I didn't get about this film was that it was sometimes confusing and kept changing direction - which is difficult when you're trying to maintain a couple of sub-plots, and I don't think this handled it very well. The comedy made it more than bearable though and the film didn't just become overly benign, self-centred on making the audience feel really sorry for the characters. In the end, this film had incredible heart in fulfilling a comedic yet thoughtful purpose."" ]";1
a-few-good-men;7;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""There were certain parts of the film that didn't really have much point, and when you think it was just getting started, it changes the scene quickly. This may or may not be a good thing. The dialogue was a bit long, but the humour was refreshing. At least the ending was unpredictable, but it still lacked the ultimate punch for me to rate this higher. On the whole, it wasn't too bad, but didn't exactly knock me off my feet."" ]";1
inception;10;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""There are often summer films that succeed visually, but are not as spectacular without the addition of intellectual thought. It takes a while to navigate through all the confusion, but it is fascinating to see how everything works. The characters couldn't have been played better. Christopher Nolan doesn't treat his viewers as if they're stupid, but neither does he pretend he's so clever that he immediately confuses everyone. This is a rare summer film that thrills as well as fascinates, providing not just visual treats, but also intellectual ones."" ]";4
never-let-me-go;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""A touching, heart-rending movie - although depressing in parts. There's so many aspects of this movie that has so much to do with real life - it triggered my sense of morality and set off my tear duct. It wasn't a cheesy movie designed to just make you cry - it wasn't even a cheesy movie at all. This movie touches on so many things, so many sensitive things that you wouldn't even think about. The plot thickens as the story continues and learn of 'completions' and 'organ donors'. This movie is a movie about real life and looks at the more sensitive and harder to touch aspects of movie aspects."" ]";2
source-code;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""An intriguing mystery with the scents of Groundhog Day and The Matrix. The special effects did not overshadow the plot, although some of it was hard to get my head round. Jake Gyllenhaal acts very realistically and the action was very well-paced. Surprisingly a very heart-pounding well crafted action thriller. The ending was fantastically unpredictable and I never would have known that it would be that beautiful. The film left on very high note."" ]";3
beginners;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""Sometimes you only realise certain things until something shocking happens. This poignant tale, which somehow goes a little over the top, tells us of the fragility of human emotion and expression, a tale of how life goes on and what we learn along the way. I loved the incorporation of the cute little dog and his subtitles of his thoughts - films never really do that, but it gave us a different perspective of not just human nature. It was crazy at times, there wasn't much talking and sometimes I felt it wasn't really trying too hard to not be what it was supposed to - an art-house film. I still find it very thought-provoking, though, and the beautiful inter-mix of humour and sadness evoked so many other emotions. Ewan McGregor was great for this role, and I can't deny the others their applause either."" ]";2
5050;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""With fantastic actors for the roles, the dark humour plays well with the situation, but the point was - neither the poignancy or comedy made it awkward, but when it did, it was done well, and it felt sweet and amusing to make light of such a horrific event. And more specifically, it managed to have not just dark humour, but also a hilarious comic effect. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has just been amazing in every film I've seen, and I still found Seth Rogen's awkward jokes funny. Great chemistry, and provided an honest account of cancer - it wasn't cheesy, it didn't feel Americanised and the way things were resolved just felt fascinating."" ]";3
ice-age-continental-drift;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""While it retreads familiar ground, this film is different from others that do the same thing. You cannot expect films like these to be directed just towards kids, because why should they subconsciously make the decision that it's childish and assume there's only a certain few that means you don't get labelled as childish if you see it? This film is almost perfectly developed for both young kids and older people - most of the characters are lovable in their own way and who seriously doesn't love Scrat? Regardless of any demographic, anybody who loves this film will have nothing against this little fella. Just when everything is going right, what's not to stop something small creating such a big disaster? I love the dialogue especially against the characters - I did like the pirates, although many of them just got on my nerves (guess that's what pirates do). And every character has their own personality that suits everyone - what's not to like?"" ]";3
premium-rush;9;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""This film is awesome. Despite having what may be called a convoluted plot, it is given strength by the intense action, superb acting and a brilliant choice of characters, not to mention the crystalline graphics of a GPS and the lively streets of New York. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just so carefree and alive in this film."" ]";3
taken-2;8;EssenceOfSugar;"[ ""I was indeed wary that this might be not up to standards of the first film, but when I saw it, I thought it was better. It was a ridiculous storyline, but Liam Neeson was still up to par, as I enjoyed him doing what he does best. I could empathise with the characters properly, as I felt I was much more comfortable with Kim being a stronger character than in the last film, while the rest of the cast were still fully capable of committing to the plot. The ending certainly proved better worth than the previous film's ending."" ]";2

The 1951 version may look cheap compared to todays standards and the ending left me wanting more, but the acting and believability are extremely high. Fortunately, the 2008 remake retains the believability. The large amount of special effects doesn't make the story of this version less interesting. My eyes remained glued to the screen as I deeply was invested in what the characters would do next. A lot more of the science and the technology of the situation is explained in this version, and putting it in the modern times didn't remove the important plot elements. I think if you enjoyed the 1951 version, you should't have many reasons to hate this one."" ]";3

It wasn't like watching a movie. It was more like watching a documentary. Because everything from the smallest facial expressions, to the most insignificant gestures is just saturated with texture and emotion. It's the quick and thoughtless remarks that the characters make, and the angles of certain glimpses of camera work that allow us, the audience, to understand what is really going on underneath all of the outward doings and occurrences. I was invested, I was interested, I was engaged and I cared about everything that was happening in this fictional world that died in two hours. Aspiring filmmakers, take notes.

However, while Finding Dory is definitely not as good as it's predecessor, it is a welcome return to the aquatic side of Pixar movies."", ""First off it's a stunning reminder of how perfect the original is in terms of animation, characters, and casting. Dory and the gang are just how you remember them and the voice acting is still some of the most incredible I have ever experienced. The cast adds nuance and life to these characters using only their voices. The animation is nothing short of gorgeous. Things like returning characters and references serve as humorous and appreciated throwbacks to the original."", ""All that said, this isn't one of those sequels that reuses plot elements and jokes from the first movie to get by. It stands on it's own as an incredible animated movie. One with it's own adventure, new characters, and plenty of original humor and heart."", ""Just like the best of Pixar's work, Finding Dory is emotional and heartwarming. The character of Dory is front and center with a stunning core performance from Ellen DeGeneres that quite frankly deserves every voice acting award out there. Now the plot itself does get a little absurd. Characters bounce around through situations that often defy logic. Honestly, I'm okay with that. Because at the end of the day it's still entertaining and you can feel it in your heart. You can also feel it in your funny bone, because it's absolutely hilarious. Simply put, Finding Dory is another masterpiece from Pixar. No, it's not as good as Finding Nemo, but honestly that kind of lighting doesn't strike twice. Instead it's a very respectable follow up that will enchant families and viewers of all ages. And at the end of the day, it still blows away just about everything else out there."" ]";1

This is, in essence, an ultra-violent manifestation and visualization of the phrase, \""you are what you are\"".

Finnick and Prim (the latter more so) were barely in the movie, despite their deaths an essential part of the story. Don't get me wrong, the deaths of those two characters were still emotional, but they would've been EVEN MORE emotional if they were featured more.

war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes;10;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""Already one of my favorite movies this year, so far. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a fitting end to a classic trilogy that revitalized the long running \""Planet of the Apes\"" franchise which started as far back as the late 1960s. This movie sees Caesar (another brilliant Andy Serkis performance) still trying to fight for survival with his entire family and friends of apes also looking for ways to survive. Things take an ugly turn when The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) discovers the apes' habitat, and Caesar feels he must take action. There is a lot to talk about in regards to the plot, but things do happen early on that the trailers did not show, so without the fear of spoiling the movie, I'll just review the movie in regards to what I loved so much about it. Director, Matt Reeves takes the personal and poignant (two words you never thought would be used to describe a \""Planet of the Apes\"" movie) aspects of the previous movie, \""Dawn\"", and makes it arguably more emotional here. Some new characters are also a welcome addition to the franchise, particularly Bad Ape (Steven Zahn), who provides just the right amount of comic relief when the movie needs levity, instead of being that funny character who overstays his welcome... in other words, he is nothing like Jar Jar Binks of the \""Star Wars\"" prequels. Serkis is obviously better than ever, playing the emotionally distraught ape, Caesar, who is still horrified after the events of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' (2014), the CGI looks just as good, if not, better than ever from the previous movie. The human characters are also very well developed, more so than in the previous two movies. This movie reminded me of 'Logan' (2017), in that, it's personal... it's not some colorful, fun blockbuster like 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017) (which I really liked), but it's also not some dumb action extravaganza like the \""Transformers\"" sequels. It's just a small, emotionally stirring and gripping movie that does not feel like a product of a big studio trying to spend their money, and waiting to make it back. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is the perfect sequel to the surprisingly great \""Rise\"", and the equally entertaining \""Dawn\"". Also, Michael Giacchino's score is as terrific as ever, probably his best work since 'Inside Out' (2015). His music just fits the tone beautifully for the movie, and is sure to get a lot of people thinking once they see this. I cannot stress this enough of how great this movie is, it's one of my favorites this year so far."" ]";1

arrival;10;MrMovieBuff;"[ ""'Arrival', along with 'Hell or High Water' (2016) is one of the best movies of the year. Director, Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario'), this film brings in some uneasy tension and atmospheric moments that will keep you hooked through its 1 hour and 55 minute run-time. Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a linguist who is selected after twelve strange extraterrestrial spacecrafts have landed in 12 different parts of the world. What they plan on doing seems unclear to everyone, until Louise manages to find a way to make contact with these strange extraterrestrials. She is brought in by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) who informs her that she might be able to help communicate with these strange species. Along her journey, she also meets military astrophysicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who remains to trust her the most when she is searching for answers. The movie creates this uneasy mix of tension and surprises, like most of Villeneuve's work, it is deliberately paced, but this makes room for some well crafted and carefully handled scenes that are pleasing to the eye. Our main character, Louise, seems emotionally distant from time to time, but we discover her backstory more and more as the film goes on. The sound editing is some of the best I've heard since 'Gravity' (2013), where anything that is loud is loud, and whenever the atmosphere is quiet, it is quiet and remains that way. There are no gimmicks or any unrealistic artificial sounds to make it an easy watch. Everything you see and hear is real. The movie should get Oscar consideration for its sound editing, not to mention that this might just be Villeneuve's best directorial work yet. He should receive a \""Best Director\"" nomination for his work here. If you love mysterious sci-fi with added tension, and even some occasional drama, with some of the best piece of filmmaking ever seen... you owe it to yourself to see 'Arrival'."" ]";1

The animation is rich and stunning, the characters are so different and unique in their own way, and the songs are just wonderful... there is almost everything to love about this movie, it's hard not to be charmed by it. The movie starts off where we hear about a royal young prince who turns away an old and disfigured woman offering him a rose. He is repulsed by her appearance and she informs him that looks are not everything, but he chooses not to listen to her. Once her appearance changes into a beautiful young woman, he tried to apologize for his shallow behavior, but she saw that there was no good in him at all, and therefore transformed him into a hideous beast and all who lived in his castle were to be transformed into inanimate objects. The rose was magical, each time, a petal would fall which would count down his fate. He must find someone to fall in love with him as well as for him to fall in love before the final petal falls. If not, then he will remain a beast for all eternity, and the same goes for those who have become inanimate objects. We are then introduced to Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) who lives peacefully with her father Maurice (Rex Everhart) in a small village in France. Belle seems to stand out against the people in her village as she is the only girl who looks \""beautiful\"" (apparently, \""Belle\"" means \""Beauty\""), and everyone seems to think that she is odd. Belle loves literature, and always loves to dive into a book, that is, until she comes across an arrogant and vain man named Gaston (Richard White) and his sidekick, LeFou (Jesse Corti). Gaston plans to marry Belle, despite not having much respect for her well-being or privacy. One day, when Maurice travels to sell his invention, he comes across a gigantic castle where he meets a candle Maitre D named Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and a clock Household staff Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers). He also meets a teapot Cook named Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury) who all welcome him in open arms. That is, until he comes across the hideous Beast (Robby Benson) who imprisons him for trespassing, when Belle finds out, she hurries along to save her father in sacrifice of her own freedom. The gang of objects sees this as an opportunity for the curse to be broken, and they try their best to teach the beast to be warm-hearted, kind and gentle to Belle, so she could fall in love with him and break the curse as soon as possible. This movie is as good as any Disney movie, ever... it's a worthy follow-up to 'The Little Mermaid' (1989) and perfectly matches the inspiration that Walt Disney himself influenced when he decided to adapt fairy-tales into animated musicals.

The fight scenes are of course classic and the acting is alright."", """", ""I'm giving this a 10 because this is a unique film in its genre that gives a real story instead of just 2 hrs of hardcore action"" ]";2
the-bfg;10;EpicLadySponge;"[ ""It's already not the end of 2016, yet this (in my opinion) is the best film everyone could see of this year. The story was actually clever, like I didn't even knew it was based on the book named the same thing, especially if it's coming from Steven Spielberg, a great director and filmmaker. The characters are all lovable (especially all the dumb giants you're randomly seeing), the visual effects feels stereoscopic, but that's not all. It's surely Disney, but it feels like it could be distributed by any film studio other than Disney. The best part about this is that it was released on my birthday.

ghostbusters-2016;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""I love this movie. The women in it are great together and all bring their own style of comedy that blends well with their cast members. I laughed throughout this film! Who doesn't love a movie that has amazingly smart women who turn-up as the heroines!"", """", ""Beyond the great comedic acting, the film makers sprinkled a lot from the previous movie in which was fantastic. There are cameos, there is the famed marshmallow man, basically same events happening. In a brilliant way, they still made the movie have it's own story-line while at the same time bringing back all the old stuff we love about the 1984 classic."", """", ""Very well done. I would pay theater money to see it again! Hopefully this cast continues making films together."" ]";1
waiting-for-lightning;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""The critics who diminished this film because they didn't hear enough from Danny are selling the film short. I've seen just about all the recent films in this genre (Dogtown and Z-Boys, Riding Giants, Step into Liquid, etc.), and I think this one is highly inspirational in its own right. You hear enough from Danny to understand his motivations. And we hear so much from celebrities and athletes today (interviews, social media), it's almost refreshing to see a guy who lets his performances and his grace speak for him. The tragic losses of Danny's male role models definitely help mold who he is, for better or for worse, but he's an incredible role model for what hard work and persistence can do for you. For a guy who is afraid of heights to do what he does is really unthinkable. Good for DC for making the film happen, and I realize it's the nature of the beast, but the entire film had a Quicksilver/DC Shoes imprint on it which is a bit unusual for a feature film - and it detracted from my enjoyment, but only slightly. It was great seeing Rob Dyrdek and Ken Block supporting Danny on the Great Wall jump. And doing that jump for a second (\""third\"") time on the big day for \""personal satisfaction\"" is just the icing on the cake. It's what true artists and competitors in this game do. For fans of skating, this is a must-see blockbuster."" ]";1

space-chimps;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""It's not a super clever and witty movie. It's not filled with depth. It's not what we've come to expect from our generation of movies after seeing Wall-E, Pixar's animated masterpiece. Adults will probably let out quite a bit of yawns, but it has some funny moments. And kids the target age will probably enjoy it. But it sure is very good."" ]";1

arthur-and-the-invisibles;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""When Arthur(Freddy Highmore) first encounters Princess Selenia(Madonna), a beautiful and indelibly feminine, but nevertheless, creature, who could've been a figment of his raconteur grandfather's imagination; \""Arthur & the Invisibles\"" brought me back to my first movie star crush. Her name was Kira. She was a gelfing. She was the most beautiful...muppet, I had ever seen(way, way, way prettier than Miss Piggy). Even though \""Arthur & the Invisibles\"" largely covers the same terrain as \""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\"", a scene like the one in which Arthur shares a rosebud-turned-bed with Princess Selenia, somewhat alleviates this formulaic film from the commercially-mandated instinct that it's noisy action in which audiences yearn for. The age difference between Arthur and Princess Selenia is provocative(they come close to kissing), but never sordid; always sweet. If \""Arthur & the Invisibles\"" had more ambition and artistry, the filmmaker could've chopped the running time of this first adventure(a tired story about recovering rubies to help save the farm), and reunited the age-challenged couple when Arthur got older. Princess Selenia isn't like the dragon in the Peter, Paul & Mary folksong(she's corporeal), but Arthur's affinity for this Minimoy may not last once he starts meeting human girls; which is what's intriguing, and potentially fatalistic, about Princess Selenia's promise that she'll wait for him."" ]";1

In the bus scenes seeing the action, mayhem, intensity happening it's just great. Overall, this is an amazing action film that you should see. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat.

3000-miles-to-graceland;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""You know, everybody has just shot this movie down like it never should have been made. What most of yall failed to do was look at it from the producer's mind. The storyline was brilliant - robbing a casino during an Elvis impersonation. This could have happened and mite happen in REAL LIFE..but no one thought about it, except the producer and for that , y'all made it sound like he was a pedophile. Common what about all the other lame things that are happening in the US?? Getting back to the movie, the music was surreal, catchy and wild. Kevin & Kurt were just incredible. Its producers like Demian Lichtenstein & Quinten Tarrantino that make movies like Pulp Fiction & 3KM2G worth going to the movies. PS : By the way, Elvis wouldn't mind one bit."" ]";1
the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle;10;SimpsonFans;"[ ""In my opinion, anyone who gives this movie a bad rating needs to remember what it was like growing up watching these characters. I saw the cartoons when they were in reruns (Hey, I'm only 27.) However, watching this movie reminded me of just how flat-out funny these guys were. The human casting was sheer brilliance, especially Robert De NIro as Fearless Leader. After seeing him in so many mob-related films, it was a refreshing change to see him basically making fun of himself. Piper Perabo was awesome in here. Rene Russo and Jason Alexander were absolutely hilarious as Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. I also enjoyed the wall-to-wall celebrity cameos such as John Goodman, Carl Reiner, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg to name a few. Yes, some of the puns are dry. But, I found most of them to be absolutely hilarious. If I have one complaint about this film, it would be that it's no where near long enough. Otherwise, this is a great movie for the entire family."" ]";1
