RESULTS INTERPRETATION
----------------------

For the sake of analysis I chose 3 favourite movies: Just Go with It, Bohemian Rapsody & The Lion King. 
Out of those, only the lion king occured in the table and thus I used that for analysis. 


Recommendation System Creation with Natural Language Processing in SQL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Full text search of summary, title & starring fields provided some usefull movie recommendations - some fields better than the others.
Results show, recommendations based on the summary field brought the highest ranking for top 50 ranging from 0.99 to 0.77. 
Most of the suggested movies correspond to the liong king e.g. 'the Simpsons Movie', 'Monsters Inc' or 'Shrek the Third'. However, 
some movies seem to not fully correspond with the lion king e.g. 'Exorcist, the beginning', 'Anacondas the hunt for the blood orchid' or 
'Ghost Rider'. This is probably due to the fact the lion king includes words like death in the summary and that's why it is also connected
with horror movies. Although there are some good recommendations in the list, I would not use this analysis in a real life. Imagine a kid
who wants to watch another animation sees a horror movie instead! To further tweak this analysis, I would have a look at genres and 
definetely exclude horror movies. Suggestions that come from a starring field are not so impressive. For the animation, the actors are
chosen based on other characteristics than for a normal movie. It does not matter if the actres is famous or not. It just needs to fit the
character of the animation. Therefore, for the lion king I would not recommend to use starring field.It could be that for some other 
movies or famous actors like James Bond, the recommendations would definetely fit. But not in this case. As for the title field, there is
only one recommendation and thus the movie itself. Threfore, in my opinion the title should not be used as main attribute of recommendation
system.
